TaylorSwift,How would you reconceptualize reputation's aesthetic for reputation(Taylor's Version)?," 

I think most of us have noticed how the aesthetics for the TVs have been.. updated so far. Taylor covers so many themes in each album, so for the TVs she's just picked other aspects from the ones highlighted during their original eras. So basically,

Red tv is now a fall album, which makes sense, especially since it was lead by ATW, the quintessential fall song. The original had this indie hipster vibe to it, and the more pop-y singles fit well into that, but the country songs definitely give off more autumn vibes to me.

1989 tv is a beach album instead of the citycore/ New York album it was. There are songs with references to nature and water, and multiple mvs feature beaches. Slut! feels like it takes place on one of those fancy rich people cruise ships, and Is It Over Now? actually features her on that boat in her blue dress.

Fearless tv is more fairytale-y and hones in more on Love Story's shiny golden aesthetic rather than the relatable teenage pain of YBWM. Technically there's only 2 photos(and a self made mv) to go off of for this, but those two definitely emphasize the fantasy escapist aspect more than the og cover with it's teenage-freedom -headbanging vibes.

Speak Now tv is a lot more mature. The black background instead of the white, Taylor's more serious expression, plus I Can See You being much more sensual capitalizes more on the more adult, grown themes of the album than the original aesthetic does.

I feel like rep is easy to conceptualize because it has a nice clean cut between the two themes it explores. The og hammers in the badass, more edgy media's pov of her, so I feel like tv will go for the more lovestruck, gentle theme like delicate. I'd like to see her do something like [this](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/3940718415183462/), [the](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/563018695620266/) [spilling wine in the bathtub](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/7248049394236242/), day [after](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/59180182595072818/) [the](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/792703971908926047/) party, kind of thing. Like [the](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/134826582586998230/) opulence of wearing fancy diamonds and rings but the relatability of being content in love. The corners are [little](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/64105994687683763/) blurred, like how everything feels a little softer around the edges when you're in love.

I'm most curious about debut, cause it has a little bit of everything, and no real clear singular aesthetic to me beyond the obvious kitschy country teen thing in the og. (I also have listened to the debut in a while so my memory of it may be rusty)

Taylor often writes about the status quo and how her relationships don‚Äôt always conform to it.

Even wondering about the possibilities of her relationship with her muse could lead to danger‚Ä¶ it may be better just to shut down the idea. ‚Äò*Wonderland*‚Äô is a dream-like state that flips reality on its head and accepts Taylor and her muse with open arms.

TaylorSwift,"Despite Taylor's popularity, why do her Christmas songs (especially ""Christmas Tree Farm"") not get the hype as do other Christmas by other pop stars?","Understandably, among those considered as ""modern holiday hits/classics"", nobody can reach the popularity of ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"", for better or worse.

But what I want to ask is, why is ""Christmas Tree Farm"" not as hyped as Ariana Grande's ""Santa Tell Me"" or Kelly Clarkson's ""Underneath the Tree"" outside the online Swiftie bubble? Ideally, if you consider Taylor's fame, ""Christmas Tree Farm"" would've had at least a week at the top of the Holiday Hot 100, like Justin Bieber's ""Mistletoe"" or ""Santa Tell Me"".

TaylorSwift,The Miss Americana documentary made me love Taylor even more than I already do.,"Okay so I know I am incredibly late to the part on this, but I finally got around to watching the Miss Americana doco on Netflix and holy shit. I was already a massive fan, but after watching that, I am an even bigger fan that I already was.

I had a general idea about what she went through during the period between1989 and Reputation (so roughly between 2014 and 2018), but I had no idea things were that bad for her.

The press, the media, the paparazzi, TMZ and all the rest mocked, ridiculed, insulted and defamed her for years over absolutely nothing. How is it a crime if she gains a bit of weight or dates a few guys or doesn't look exactly like they want her to? Oh that's right, it's only a crime because she is a celebrity. The paparazzi and TMZ in particular are nothing but bloodsucking, life ruining scumbags with no morals, no respect and no boundaries. They called her a liar  and a fake? THEY are the ones who are liars and fakes? Would anybody have given a shit about any of it if she wasn't famous? Absolutely not.

And as far as the lie that Kayne West made her famous, that is complete and utter bullshit. SHE won the award that year, not Beyonce. Plus, Kayne and his career are done now that everyone knows he is a Nazi.

My point is, Taylor is one of the most talented people to ever work in the music industry PERIOD. She writes all of her own music and she even said fuck you to the record labels and rerecorded her first 6 albums so that she would own the masters to her own music. She is a smart girl. Plus, the Eras Tour is now BY FAR the most successful tour in history and for good reason. Keep it up girl and don't listen to what those fucks online and at TMZ say.

TaylorSwift,Why is Midnights so divisive?,"Outside of the Swifties it seems like midnights is one of the most well liked albums by Taylor, but within the community the opinion seems to be very mid at best. Why is this? It seems like the logical progression of her music, with interesting production, lots of lore, great lyricism etc. Is it so different from the existing work that it doesn't appeal to Swifties at large?

I personally love the album and think it's one of her best, but I'd love to know what people who don't love it as much feel about it!",0.93,639,0,639,orangeants,2023-12-29 10:12:04,18tizsz,t3_18tizsz

No. Because we're halfway through (if Part 10 has a tie) and... you know the context for reputation. But before we go ahead and vote, let me show you how you voted, and so it goes...

**Notes and voting**

* 43 people voted in Part 5! Thanks for all the votes!
* Bad Blood and I Know Places tie as the most reputation-ish song in 1989, with 17 votes, 14 votes ahead of the third placing song, Blank Space.
* Clean was voted the most folklore and evermore-ish song. You'll have to vote which vibe Clean gives, one song per slot...
* Since there's one extra slot, I **felt the need to confess,** I found who the Swiftie who inspired the series was, u/klcna
* I Don't Wanna Live Forever will be counted as a reputation song

TaylorSwift,Predicting the future direction to Taylor's discography,"She has virtually covered a huge space of themes like- girlhood, redemption, relationships, heartbreaks, hypotheticals, forgiveness, near-engagements, friendships and more.

I'm absolutely excited to know where can she steer next after the Eras tour.

The contemporary artist I can think of is Adele, her 25 album talked about relationships, while her 30 album spoke of marriage and divorce.

As an artist who primarily writes about romantic relationships, how does one reinvent without being repetitive?

I mean, I understand using acronyms for songs like All You Had To Do Was Stay, This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things, All Of The Girls You Loved Before, etc. but where do we draw the line? At the same time, people get upset when people use acronyms for songs like Sad Beautiful Tragic or The Moment I Knew, but I think that's still mostly reasonable.

I'm interested to see if we can come up with some sort of consensus.

TaylorSwift,What would be even more iconic if Taylor won AOTY 4 times? If Taylor won AOTY in 4 genres.,"Okay so AOTY stands for the Grammy‚Äôs Album Of The Year and and in AOTY history, Taylor is tied with 3 other icons for having the most AOTY. Midnights is nominated for AOTY next Grammy season, so if Taylor wins, she‚Äôll officially be the first person in AOTY history to have the most wins. But honestly, I don‚Äôt think Midnights deserves it and I think it would be even more historical to win AOTY 4 times in 4 different genres. 

Taylor‚Äôs first AOTY was country (Fearless), second was pop (1989), last was folk (folklore), and in my hypothetical scenario, I would prefer her 4th win to be in rock. Lots of fans, including myself, want Taylor to explore the rock scene more.

Also, Midnights was a great album, but subjectively not her best imo. I think it‚Äôs up against some great contenders though, SZA‚Äôs SOS, Olivia‚Äôs Guts, Boygenius‚Äôs The Record, etc.

Also in this hypothetical scenario, I‚Äôd imagine/hope that Taylor completely blows people away in her new genre, she blew people away when she first entered pop and she also blew people away when she first entered folk.

Edit: I agree that folklore sounds more popish, but it‚Äôs labeled as indie-folk/alternative and mostly referred to those genres when talked about.

Edit 2: Taylor ran folklore as pop vocal for the nomination, missed opportunity",0.75,130,0,130,AfterJello666,2023-12-29 05:18:35,18te24l,t3_18te24l

TaylorSwift,Eras Tour Mega-Edit + New Year's Eve countdown video,"We have a family tradition of welcoming the New Year with a precisely-timed movie viewing, whereby a climactic moment happens at midnight. We've done *Star Wars* ([death star explodes](https://twitter.com/MileHightheGrey/status/1079996521280651264) at midnight), *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* ([""so it begins""](https://youtu.be/Dv6-dM5c_UA) at midnight), *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* ([""JUMANJI!!!!""](https://youtu.be/Dv6-dM5c_UA) at midnight), and *My Little Pony: The Movie* ([sonic rainboom](https://vimeo.com/785574353) at midnight).

A few weeks ago, I had the idea that it'd be fun to ring in 2024 with a video of *Applause,* *You Don't Own Me*, and the Eras Tour countdown, timed so the Eras clock would strike zero at midnight. But I couldn't find a good video along those lines... so [**I decided to make one**](https://milehighbrendan.com/edits).

What started as a simple idea turned into a hugely involved project, featuring parts of 76 different videos by 58 different people at 34 different shows ‚Äî including at least one clip from all 24 Eras Tour cities. In some cases, people sent me their videos; in other cases, I found a video on TikTok and got permission to use it.

Anyway, the final countdown/mega-edit video is 18 minutes long, featuring a continuous, multi-perspective, multi-city recording of *Applause,* *You Don't Own Me, Miss Americana,* and *Cruel Summer,* followed by *New Year's Day* from Los Angeles N6. **If you start watching it at exactly 11:54 PM, the Eras Tour countdown clock will strike zero at midnight.** 

You can find it on [**YouTube**](https://youtu.be/ifWdqZRnv98), as well as [**Vimeo**](https://vimeo.com/898285627) and [**Streamable**](https://streamable.com/zqdl2y).

TaylorSwift,Album battle let‚Äôs gooooo!!,"Take your top two Taylor albums and pit them against each other. You are allowed to make ties, BUT you must have a double elimination for every tie you make. 

For me: Speak Now vs. evermore

Mine vs willow- literally my favorite two track 1‚Äôs, willow would usually sweep but Mine is my favorite Taylor song of all time. Would be a tie if I didn‚Äôt know what was coming. 

Sparks Fly vs champagne problems- Sparks Fly

Back to December vs gold rush- TIE. Literally could not live without either of these. Two of my favs of all time. There‚Äôs no way to decide. 

Speak Now vs ‚Äòtis the dam season- ‚Äòtis the damn season 

Dear John vs tolerate it- oh my god?? My two favorite track 5‚Äôs. Tolerate it is my second favorite Taylor song of all time but I cannot force myself to cut Dear John. It‚Äôs another tie. 

Mean vs. no body, no crime- no body, no crime (the Mean bridge is iconic though)

The Story of Us vs. happiness- The Story of Us (hot take- this is a top 10 Taylor song)

Never Grow Up vs dorothea- Never Grow Up

Enchanted vs. coney island- coney island (hear me out)

Better Than Revenge vs. ivy- ivy (both slap)

Haunted vs. cowboy like me- Haunted

Innocent vs long story short- Double elimination 

Last Kiss vs. marjorie- both are devastating, I‚Äôm giving it to Last Kiss but could go either way

Long Live vs closure- second double elim. (I like Long Live but I had to cut her in the name of Dear John)

Speak Now- 8
evermore- 6

Speak Now wins! I prefer evermore as a whole and still consider evermore as my favorite Taylor album, but both are god tier. 

Alright, now do yours. I wanna see people‚Äôs opinions.


Editing to add bonus tracks:

Ours vs. evermore- evermore (underrated and incredible)

Superman vs. right where you left me- right where you left me (one of my favs of all time)

Electric Touch vs. it‚Äôs time to go- tbh might double elim these to save both Mine and willow

Final Total: 

Speak Now- 8

TaylorSwift,Suburban Legends parallel?,"I was listening to Suburban Legends recently and realised why I love the ending so much. She repeats the lines twice--but she changes ""You don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined"" to ""You don't knock anymore and I always knew it."" And god, the genius of that: like, look, my life's ruined and I can substitute that by saying ""I always knew it"" because that's what she *did* know: that her life would be ruined. It's so clever!!! But it's also such a Taylor move: to take satisfaction--even vindication--in being the one who knows, even if destruction is on its way. AHHHHH. Anyway, I reckon you may already have noticed this but I was so excited about it I just needed to tell someone. Are there other moments/parallels she makes that you've noticed like this which you really enjoy? Tell me, so I can go listen to a song all over again!!",0.92,65,0,65,rainyaugustnight,2023-12-28 12:04:38,18srfe7,t3_18srfe7
TaylorSwift,The archer is better off as the closing track of Lover,"Ever since I sat down to analyze the tracklist of Lover I've come to the realization that it is probably one of her most most messy/less thought of ones (unlike what I used to think few months back), this is probably due to the era itself, which was a fever dream to put it lightly. The issue with the lover era is that it feels too ""controlled"" perhaps even manufactured due her trying to shift the public's attention from the persona she acted as in the reputation era. This manufactured quality comes off very obvious esp in three important tracks of every album, the lead single, the track 5, and the album closer.

 We all know and love the tracks 5 due to their meaning and truly devastating lyrics and don't get me wrong, the archer does this, but it's too much, as if it had been done from the start with the intention of being a track 5, it doesn't sound like it was done naturally and then put in the 5 spot, it sounds as if Taylor sat down and said ""ok it's time to make the track 5 of the album"" unlike most of the other ones especially prior to her finding out that it was a thing. The archer tries so hard to be a song that elludes sad and devastating feelings but in a simple and direct way, take all too well for the example and replace ""you almost ran the red cause you were looking over at me, wind in my hair I was there I remember it all to well"" with "" you used to focus your attention and love in me and now you don't, I remember it all too well"" that's how the archer feels to me.

Now why do I think that the archer was better as the album closer, considering that the central statement of this era is the miss americana documentary, this song leaves us with an interesting theme. A line that is present at the start and end of the song is ""combat I'm ready for combat"" which does a way better job at representing Taylor's mentality and objective during the lover era which was to speak up against the unfairness and other issues that affected and would affect her career and the life of people in general, this is already way better than the fiasco Daylight is at closing the tracklist (I still love Daylight, but is just not good as a closing track) but it also represents the idea she had of stepping down from the popstar icon status she had at this era, she wanted to slow down her music production to step down from stardom as amiable and quietly as possible, hence making the lyrics ""who could ever leave me darling, but who could stay?"" Have much heavier emotional value to us fans and feel more naturally sad sounding.

As for the song that would take the track 5 spot, in the album the one that comes off as the most track 5 is Cornelia street, very vulnerable anxious song, and it doesn't sound manufactured to make you feel sad!

When she changed lyrics to a song to reference him the internet just about broke down and consensus was that it meant they were pretty serious

Edit: I do think the most likely is Scott Swift appearing because he's a massive football fan and actually played football (both positions Jason played) at the college level....however I dont think he'd appear until he was 100% ok with Travis proposing - not saying Travis would have to ask before hed appear, but just in terms of the level of comfort of Scott putting himself out there and appearing on his daughters boyfriend's podcast.",0.65,36,0,36,TheFrederalGovt,2023-12-28 01:11:26,18sfllz,t3_18sfllz

***You must take out a full length song for each song or a medley of up to 3 songs (can include a cover). This is for a realistic performance because let‚Äôs be honest, we all just want her to perform every song she has.***

Starting off, I wanted to start with what my idea of how I‚Äôd change the setlist.

I submitted: Back To December, a Picture To Burn/Should‚Äôve Said No Medley, Our Song, and Red

I took out in return: The Archer, Cardigan, Tis The Damn Season, and Mastermind.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;THE END OF THE TOUR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Remember, even the deleted songs can be put back in for another song to be taken out, you just have to choose which one. It doesn‚Äôt even need to replace a song from its own section, it just has to be replaced. 

Also, check before you submit to see if anyone else has requested a similar submission and be nice in the comments. Other than that, go crazy! 

P.S. I wouldn‚Äôt advise it, but taking out ATW 10 gives you three full song submissions. üòâ just saying.


Changes: 
1. The 1 for Cardigan
2. Lover for Exile
3. Bejeweled for I Did Something Bad
4. Betty for Clean
5. Blank Space for New Romantics
6. Wildest Dreams for Out Of The Woods

TaylorSwift,Comedy (Taylor's Version) - January 18 in LA!,"Hi everyone!! My friend is a NEW DIE HARD SWIFTIE to the point that she's creating an entire show about it. I think it's going to be amazing and it's aptly named [Comedy (Taylor's Version).](https://bit.ly/48zdiuc) 

It‚Äôs a panel show about (obviously) Taylor and my friend's backwards journey into becoming a swiftie through her love of the NFL/Travis Kelce. The comedians for the first show are Raphael Vargas Chestang (*College Humor, The G Word with Adam Conover*), and Hank Chen (*Blue Bloods, Transparent*). 

Each round is inspired by a Taylor song (e.g. the song 22 will be a rapid-fire, 22-second round), and the show is divided into quarters (with a halftime show).

Anyway, if you're in LA, [I hope you'll check it out](https://bit.ly/48zdiuc)! Yes, there will be friendship bracelets.

Thanks!

December 27 2006

H'ville, TN

So I got to check off my first life goal today. My album sold 61,000 copies last week!!! My goal was to sell 50,000 in one week. We flew by that. How CRAZY is that? How crazy is this I‚Äôm playing the Wild Hose Saloon tomorrow night and I‚Äôm SO excited. All of my friends are coming. Cannot WAIT. It‚Äôs gonna be a fun show. So I‚Äôve been home since Christmas. Let‚Äôs see, life is pretty good. I‚Äôm now obsessed with Law + Order. Completely obsessed. And my album‚Äôs about to go gold. Haven‚Äôt kissed a boy in 209 days.

Note: For this section, I've decided that any song that starts with the word ""the"" will be treated as if ""the"" is not there. Taylor has a LOT of songs that start with ""T"" so this will help the spread a little. 

* Check the comments section for past polls, they stay open.
* Place your highest ranking at the top, and your lowest at the bottom.
* You can rank based off of which are your own personal favorites, or which tracks you consider to be objectively ""best"". Whatever you prefer.

TaylorSwift,Thank you to everyone in this community for an amazing 2023 (r/taylorswift appreciation post),"So with 2023 coming to an end, I have this thing I like to do at the end of the year where I thank people for anything that might have happened over the past year.

And with that, I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone here on this sub for all the moments we've had this year (and there have been a lot of them!)

Thank you to everyone on here who participated with me in one of the clowning threads, album announcement/release threads (two of each this year!), concert threads, or Taylor-at-the-NFL game threads. Everyone who commented a joke (or Travis Kelce meme) that made me laugh, or showed off their artwork. Thank you to everyone who ran a game on this sub this year. And everyone who made a post, or a comment, and added to a discussion. I love how much of a great place this is to discuss all the latest events in Taylorland.

And of course, thank you to the mod team here for keeping it that way.

I have seen how not every corner of the internet is the nicest place (I literally don't have any other social media), so I really appreciate everyone here and how nice and welcoming this place, especially for someone who still considers themself a new Swiftie (even though I joined during folklore so it's been a few years now).

TaylorSwift,Which two albums can‚Äôt you believe only have one album in between them?,"I‚Äôve been thinking about this on and off for the past couple of weeks. With how often Taylor likes to flip the switch with her work, sometimes it is crazy to think how two albums only have one album in between them. 

Here‚Äôs the list: 

Debut - Fearless - Speak Now 

Fearless - Speak Now - Red 

Speak Now - Red - 1989 

Red - 1989 - reputation 

1989 - reputation - Lover 

reputation - Lover - folklore 

Lover - folklore - evermore

TaylorSwift,What‚Äôs up with Taylor and Towns?,"Have you guys noticed that Taylor has this thing where she compares people, or her emotional state, to towns across multiple songs? 

Examples: 

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou were my town, now I‚Äôm in exile seeing you out.‚Äù 

*‚ÄúStaring out the window, like I‚Äôm not your favorite town.‚Äù* 

*‚ÄúMy town was a wasteland, full of cages, full of fences.‚Äù*

Why do we think she puts it this way? Is it a favorite metaphore, like the slamming doors, or do you have another theory? Let‚Äôs discuss!",0.89,167,0,167,Sketch-Brooke,2023-12-26 22:10:14,18rid2g,t3_18rid2g

TaylorSwift,What song of Taylor do you think has a few or even zero haters?,"Taylor has many songs and it's not rare for a person to have negative opinions on a song. But what song do you think has very few haters?

My personal pick is one of my favorite songs, The Story Of Us! I've NEVER seen any hate or slander of this song. Most people love it, some are indifferent about it but I've never seen hate for it. And it's also pretty impressive because it's a single, which tends to have haters (especially the Lover singles). 

Honorable mention goes to The Great War, my favorite Midnights 3AM track. I think everyone collectively agreed to like this masterpiece.",0.94,485,0,485,10thDoctorWhooves,2023-12-26 15:43:43,18r9kdc,t3_18r9kdc

TaylorSwift,Name Taylor‚Äôs Best and Worst Produced Song. What is a song that had potential if it was better produced?,"Disclaimer: my opinion is mine and mine alone not trying to start any drama obviously i love taylor

Okay I‚Äôm saying this as a person who has listened to her stuff on STUDIO MONITORS which totally distorts how songs sound in comparison to streaming, and kinda find her to lack in this area more than other artists (ariana grande specifically)

Best Produced Song(s): False God, Dress, MATHP, and call it what you want, wildest dreams, my tears ricochet 

Worst: You‚Äôre Losing Me, All of the Girls You Loved Before (i know these were likely just straight file uploads but i wish they tried harder to make them sound like they belong on the OG album 

Most Potential: CARDIGAN!!!! MAROON!!! Slut (even tho i love it as is i think it could‚Äôve been way more of a smash) and willow. Not that they aren‚Äôt all amazing as is and the public didn‚Äôt love them, but they have the potential to be even more immersive and cinematic",0.7,31,0,31,Impossible-Soil6330,2023-12-27 05:48:15,18rs4mt,t3_18rs4mt
TaylorSwift,[Part 5] Most (album here)-ish 1989 song + a bit of tiebreakers from Part 4.,"Yes. You read the title right. Welcome to the part of Taylor's first full-pop album (as advertised by mother), it's been waiting for you, right after disclosing your votes from Part 4, currently closed

**Notes and voting**

* **As of** ***closure***, 35 of you voted, which is a disappointing decrease, but thank you for voting.
* I Knew You Were Trouble was voted the **most reputation-ish song** in Red, with 15 votes. That's a **10 vote gap** from the runner up, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, surprisingly, as they give the same vibe.
* There is one tie- the one for the most Fearless-ish song (Everything Has Changed and Begin Again).
* Two songs took two slots in the table, Stay Stay Stay (Debut and Lover) and Nothing New (folklore and Midnights). Part 4 was really hard to find a consensus, wasn't it? You will do the same thing you guys did to I Can See You back in Part 4.

TaylorSwift,"As a 1989 era stan, Midnights is an extremely interesting era","I‚Äôve always said this, but Midnights reminds me of 1989‚Äôs dark side. I see them as duo albums like Folklore and Evermore. 

1989 is very flashy and happy, it‚Äôs very 2013-14 era coded. It‚Äôs like the ‚Äúpeak‚Äù, but Midnights gives me those same vibes but 2022-23 coded. It‚Äôs a little more mysterious. it‚Äôs like you have to find the jewels in this album while 1989 it‚Äôs in your face. 

Midnights to me is 1989 but without the rose colored glasses. 

Also, this is just my personal analysis of these albums. I feel as if there are a lot of dual songs that personally go together too. 

Bad Blood = Karma 
Shake It Off = You‚Äôre On Your Own Kid 
Welcome To New York = Maroon or Lavender Haze 

again, this is just a personal opinion/interpretation of what i see coming from a 1989 stan who‚Äôs also becoming a Midnights stan. 

I just find the colors, lyrics, and era itself SO interesting. the way she does her eyeliner. To me it LITERALLY looks like a darker, softer version of 1989.",0.94,65,0,65,ceoofindica,2023-12-26 21:40:31,18rhowv,t3_18rhowv

I‚Äôll start with Style and OOTW. I love how these songs reflect on the same relationship in really different ways. Style is so fun and feels almost like a romanticization of a toxic relationship.

TaylorSwift,Funny blast from the past here in People magazine,"What exactly do [Taylor Swift,](https://people.com/tag/taylor-swift/) Jeremy Renner and Channing Tatum all have in common?

They all had guest roles on [*CSI*](https://people.com/tv/csi-star-william-petersen-hospitalized-after-falling-ill-on-set/) before they were *famous* famous, of course!

Swift, now 34, was on the popular drama in 2009 when she was just 19. She was promoting her second album *Fearless,* and as a mega *CSI* fan at the time, she was telling journalists that the guest role was a dream come true.

""For about three years I‚Äôve been saying to everyone that my favorite show is *CSI*,‚Äù Swift told a *Rolling Stone* journalist. This original interview is in the latest series of her [*Infamous*](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/infamous/id1652941051) podcast, [a four-part series about Swift conquering the world.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/infamous/id1652941051?i=1000638487307)

The interviews include Swift talking about her experience on *CSI*, where she first played a dead body, and then teenager Haley Jones, whose story viewers learned about in flashbacks.

""The character Nick Stokes \[played by George Eads\], it's his crime that he deals with,"" Swift said of the episode, in which she played the teen who lived at a seedy motel with her parents.

But we noticed how hard it is and that usually heartbreaking emotional songs are favoured over fun pop songs as no party songs could ever reach the lyrical significance of an folkmore song. Even though of course we prefer the more energetic songs when going out/doing group karaoke.

So we changed to asking not for one favourite song, but their favourite emotional AND favourite fun song/bop and even though it is still hard, it made things actually easier haha.

TaylorSwift,reputation - Light and Dark,"Ahh....my favourite album

 ""Reputation"" is Taylor Swift's sixth studio album, released in 2017. The album marked a significant departure from her previous work, both musically and thematically. 

 

**Dark Themes in ""Reputation"":**

1. **Media Scrutiny and Reputation Damage:**  


* A significant dark theme in the album is Taylor Swift's response to intense media scrutiny and the damage to her public image. Songs like ""Look What You Made Me Do"" and ""This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things"" address the impact of negative press and public perception.

1. **Betrayal and Broken Relationships:**  


* Many songs explore themes of betrayal and the breakdown of relationships. ""I Did Something Bad"" and ""Getaway Car"" delve into the complexities of love gone wrong, with elements of deceit and regret.

1. **Defiance and Resilience:**  


* The darker tracks exhibit a sense of defiance and resilience in the face of adversity. ""Look What You Made Me Do"" and ""End Game"" express a determination to overcome challenges and emerge stronger.

1. **Isolation and Loneliness:**  


* Some songs convey a sense of isolation and loneliness that can come with fame. In ""Delicate,"" Swift explores the vulnerability of being in the public eye and the challenges of finding genuine connections.

**Light Themes in ""Reputation"":**

1. **New Love and Vulnerability:**  


* Amidst the darker themes, there are moments of lightness that focus on new love and vulnerability. ""Delicate"" is a prime example, where Swift expresses the delicate nature of a budding romance.

1. **Reflection and Growth:**  


* The album also touches on themes of personal reflection and growth. ""New Year's Day"" is a poignant track that hints at starting afresh, learning from past experiences, and embracing personal growth.

1. **Intimate Moments in Relationships:**  


* ""Gorgeous"" is a lighthearted and playful song that captures the excitement and humor of being attracted to someone. It contrasts with the more intense tracks on the album.

1. **Celebration of Love:**  


* In certain moments, there's a celebration of love, particularly in the context of finding stability and happiness in personal relationships. ""Dress"" and ""King of My Heart"" touch on the joy and fulfillment found in love.

TaylorSwift,What were your unexpected favorite song performances on the Eras tour?,"I just watched the Eras Tour movie and was really shocked by how powerful My Tears Ricochet was!

When I'm happy, it's hard for me to resonate with sad songs, but I just love the performance of this so much. I kept going back, especially for her to belt ""and I still talk to you/ when I'm screaming at the sky"" 

I went back to the original and the Long Pond sessions and that bit is a lot more muted. When she belts it in the stadium I think it adds so much! I can't wait until we can get the live stadium recording of a lot of these songs because of stuff like that. 

I also really enjoyed the Willow performance. I think both performances really add something to the songs. The background dancers make it so powerful but in a slightly witchy, creepy way.

What about you guys? Were there any songs that were surprisingly good on the tour that you didn't think too much about before?",0.97,61,0,61,bonitalapin,2023-12-26 00:32:19,18qtzzb,t3_18qtzzb

TaylorSwift,My very first Taylor Swift album,"For perspective, I am a 34 yo male on the ASD spectrum who just stated really getting into Taylor Swift. My journey with her music started with Lover, particularly the emotional ""Soon You Get Better"", the song featuring the fabulous band ""The Chicks"". (Fell in love with the Chicks music as a child.) Then the following year, Folklore and Evermore dropped. So far, I have considered myself a Folklore/ Evermore Swiftie. My favorite off of Folklore is "" The last great american dynasty"", while my fav from Evermore is ""no body, no crime"", featuring HAIM. Now in 2023, I saw her amazing Eras Tour movie, along with buying the collectable popcorn and drink cups, as well as bought my 1st TS album. Favorite tracks so far are ""Out of the Woods"", and ""Slut"". I also like the new version of ""Blank Space"" more than the original, mainly the drums.

Red is also the name of Taylor's fourth album, and the album we'll be covering. But before that, let's go through your voting from Part 3 (which is closed now)

**Notes and Voting**

* You guys! Thank you so much for responding! We've got an increase in voting to 45.
* By a long shot, Mean was voted the most Debut-ish song in Speak Now, with *21* votes, with the largest gap between the first and second-placing votes
* Enchanted and Ours tied for the most Lover-ish song. However, since Enchanted was the most Speak Now-ish song, we're not doing any tiebreakers, yaey!
* I Can See You was voted for most 1989 and Midnights-ish song, which kind of proves that they're similar. However, only one song can be fit into a slot in this table, so you'll be voting for which album vibe does I Can See You give.
* Eyes Open and Safe and Sound will be counted as Red songs (they're in The More Red (Taylor's Version) chapter)

TaylorSwift,DIY Eras Tour Ornament,"My best friend and I went to the Eras tour together this summer. I randomly had the idea that I could put our friendship bracelets inside clear ornaments yesterday but while getting them out of my memory box, I also found my VIP lanyard and decided to cut it in half and add it to each ornament.

I took the main ribbon and tied the eras lanyard piece around the center of it, then tied a bow with the main ribbon. I then attached it to the ornament with hot glue and also folded the ends of the lanyard back and glued them as well so the edges wouldn‚Äôt fray. 

The whole project only took 5 minutes to complete.

TaylorSwift,The songs she released before their respective re-recordings were to test how receptive the public was to the new producers.,"Maybe I‚Äôm just slow, but I realized that Taylor released the TV songs prior to their re-recordings release to test how swifties would react to change in producers. Lemme explain:

Love Story TV: the first re-recorded song to be released, and the one to show how the country songs will sound since Nathan Chapman couldn‚Äôt return for them. 

You All Over Me: shows how Aaron Dessner will be the first main producer for the vault songs.

Mr. Perfectly Fine: shows how Jack Antonoff will be the second main producer for the vault songs. 

Wildest Dreams TV: shows how Chris Rowe will produce the Max Martin pop songs going forward since he won‚Äôt be returning. 

This Love TV: shows how Chris Rowe will produce the Nathan Chapman pop song since, again, he won‚Äôt be returning. 

Taylor isn‚Äôt releasing singles based on the popularity they will gain, she is releasing them to test the waters, which explains how there wasn‚Äôt any singles released prior to Speak Now and Red. And no, I am not including the droplet songs at the beginning of the eras tour because we already got the albums they‚Äôre on.

Edit: I also forgot Elvira, since she did the Love Story remix and was the secondary producer for a few of the songs, like Girl At Home and Message In A Bottle, so the remix was also released to show her off. ",0.83,34,0,34,Fabulous-Turnip-8805,2023-12-24 20:58:09,18q2kat,t3_18q2kat

I remember when it was first revealed and I was very disappointed, my first thought was, ""Why are we looking at the back of her head?"" 

Folklore had the prettiest cover, and yet it has all these alternative covers. Evermore has the worst picture, and has no alternative covers. Makes me sad. I just want an Evermore with an alternative cover picture. There were so many better ones she could have chosen from.

The hilarious part was, we ended up making them twice, cause the first time we got everything all mixed to find out that I had accidentally grabbed my container that had ‚Äúall purpose baking flour‚Äù instead of white flour (I keep all my dry goods in clear canisters because we get mice, it was labeled right on the front of it what it was and I just didn‚Äôt look at the label, looked exactly like the one with white flour in it! ü§£).

1 - You can now view your ranking via a weighted average! I‚Äôm so sorry the Net Promoter Scoring system was confusing for some of you. Simply make another copy of the spreadsheet (same link as below) and then copy/paste Column B from the Song Ranking tab in the first spreadsheet to Column B in the new spreadsheet (Tab 2a).

2 - I also added a new breakdown that is just the original releases, extracting vault/bonus/deluxe tracks added way after the original release. (For example: I kept New Romantics as part of 1989, but did not include Better Man from Red.)

Thanks so much for having fun with this! If you have any more questions or corrections, please let me know!

TaylorSwift,Reminiscing from an OG fan,"Just thought I‚Äôd share this story since another poster shared one of her first TS concert tickets and it reminded me I‚Äôve never shared this story. 

I was in college at the University of Alabama in 2008 when I heard of a local contest to participate in MTV‚Äôs ‚ÄúOnce Upon a Prom‚Äù in which someone from Hillcrest High School (in Tuscaloosa, Alabama) would get to take Taylor Swift to prom. She was going to miss her senior prom because she was on tour opening for Rascal Flatts at the time. (Abigail went too!) A sweet, local young man named Whit, won the contest and I thought it was such a cool experience for a high school kid to go to prom with a celebrity. He seemed so excited and genuine and I couldn‚Äôt have been happier for this new local celebrity. More on that in the linked video where you can watch the entire episode. I haven‚Äôt watched it since it aired so some details of the contest may be fuzzy. 

Fast-forward 12 years later and I‚Äôm a middle school teacher three hours away from Tuscaloosa and on the first day of school, I‚Äôm having students anonymously share fun facts about themselves as our class tries to guess who they are about from our class. One of the facts that is shared is that ‚ÄùTaylor Swift held me as a baby!‚Äù As a huge Swiftie, I was really excited to figure out who this was about. When the boy was revealed, he told the story of how his Uncle Whit went to prom with Taylor Swift. When she picked him up, Whit‚Äôs entire family was there, including an infant, who was now my student standing in front of me. Taylor posed for pictures and held him in the picture. 

Now at this point, I thought my student was trying to pull one over on me. However, this student‚Äôs dad was also a teacher and the boy said, ‚ÄúGet my dad to show you the picture when you see him.‚Äù

Sure enough, his dad found the picture to show me  and he and his family are all in the picture and TS is holding him as a baby. I told the kid, ‚ÄúDude, you can have this as a trump card in your back pocket for life.‚Äù 

I just thought it was quite a serendipitous sequence of events and thought I‚Äôd share a cute little story that I‚Äôve never shared.",0.97,24,0,24,awesomearugula,2023-12-24 06:01:30,18pnz91,t3_18pnz91

TaylorSwift,What's a clever lyric from a Taylor song that took you time to figure out?,"It's always fun when you realize that a lyric has a more interesting meaning than you thought. Here are some lyrics that come to my mind:

&amp;#x200B;

*""Darling, it was good""* from Holy Ground. I didn't know that ""it was good"" is a phrase from the Bible so didn't understand the connection with the title of the song. It's quite neat imo.

""*In a world of boys, he's a gentleman""* from Slut! I just think it's interesting that she's using the word gentleman to describe him in a song where others are calling her a slut. It's an interesting juxtaposition of labels.

*""You can aim for my heart, go for blood; but you will still miss me in your bones""* I appreciated the diction of connecting 'heart', 'blood' and 'bones' in a lyric but I didn't realize that the word ""miss"" can be applied in two ways here - the second, less obvious one being in context of missing the metaphorical arrow that the subject is aiming her heart with.

""Talk your talk and go viral, I just need this love spiral"" from Lavender Haze. I like 'viral' and 'spiral' as rhymes but the fact they have opposite connotations is cooler. Viral is going outwards while spiral goes inwards.

TaylorSwift,Taylor stalking is out of control and you should care,"Over the past couple years, I‚Äôve noticed how insane the stalking has gotten for Taylor. I‚Äôve been a fan for ten years and I think the press needs to back off a f- ton. 

I recall when the Eras Tour came to town and the radio had gotten word of when her plane would be landing. One of the radio hosts immediately called out the other host, who shared the info with the audience, saying it was creepy, and, yeah, it definitely is. But Taylor isn‚Äôt the type of person to tell people not to stalk her even though I think it‚Äôs very fair at this point to ask the press to back off. The world doesn‚Äôt need to know where she is and she has too many psychos that have gotten insanely good at breaking into houses. 

And what‚Äôs sad is they a lot of people are going to say ‚Äúwell she has security, she chooses when she wants to be seen-‚Äú NO. There have been times where she clearly did not want to be seen and had to go to extreme lengths to not be seen at all. I mean, she opened up about what she did in 2016(?), after the internet was mercilessly mean to to her, where she moved to a house in a foreign country and did NOT leave it for months. MONTHS. 

So, I think we need to have a certain level of respect for people who have careers in the public eye and don‚Äôt blindly assume they can tolerate the public watching them all the time. Lines need to be drawn. If you see an article sharing creepy info about her location, maybe you should just NOT share that.",0.85,419,0,419,NoProfessional7505,2023-12-23 06:08:19,18oy9wv,t3_18oy9wv

TaylorSwift,The keys to Taylor's success (WSJ),"Hi everyone! Taylor is the star of our Science of Success column this week, so I thought I would share some of the highlights. Our columnist Ben Cohen tracks her ambition and tenacity from some of the earliest moments of her career:

&gt;\[Ambition is\] her defining trait‚Ä¶ the animating force of Swift‚Äôs career since the very beginning.

&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big advocate for not hiding your enthusiasm for things,‚Äù she said last year in her New York University commencement address. ‚ÄúNever be ashamed of trying. Effortlessness is a myth. The people who wanted it the least were the ones I wanted to date and be friends with in high school. The people who want it the most are the people I now hire to work for my company.‚Äù

&gt;‚Ä¶Even before she had released a single album, Swift was unapologetically ambitious. She was a teenager who knew what she wanted and how to make it happen.¬†

&gt;She also knew that her success in the music business would be as much about her music as her business.¬†

&gt;She has combined artistic genius with corporate savvy for as long as she can remember‚Äîand even before she was born. Swift has said there are two reasons she was called Taylor: because of James Taylor and because her mother felt it would help to have a gender-neutral name atop her r√©sum√© and business cards. Her father was a stockbroker, and when teachers asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, a young Taylor Swift stood out in her classroom of aspiring ballerinas and astronauts. ¬†

&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be a financial adviser!‚Äù she declared.¬†

&gt;Then she realized some bigger dreams of hers.¬†

&gt;When industry executives made the terrible mistake of not taking her seriously, the girl who described herself as the most competitive person she knew took matters into her own hands.¬†

&gt;She returned home to Pennsylvania, learned the 12-string guitar and practiced until her bleeding fingers had to be taped so she could keep playing. She began writing songs after school and before it was time for homework. She scribbled down unforgettable lyrics on the pages of her spiral-bound notebooks and Kleenex tissues. And she came up with the idea for ‚ÄúTim McGraw,‚Äù the first track on her first album, a song that she‚Äôll be playing for the rest of her life, while she was in freshman math class.¬†

&gt;The remarkable part about everything that happened next is that it was not remotely surprising.

&gt;Once she had some music to play, she made sure people would listen. She lugged around equipment to perform her first concerts for garden clubs and Boy Scout troops. She sent handwritten thank-you notes to the radio programmers who put her songs on the air, as my colleague Anne Steele reported, and she went out of her way to remember details about the spouses and children of the executives she dealt with.¬†

&gt;Forget what she wrote in her classic song ‚ÄúFifteen‚Äù: Count to ten, take it in/This is life before you know who you‚Äôre gonna be.¬†

&gt;Taylor Swift knew precisely who she was gonna be.¬†

&gt;‚ÄúI was always very calculated about it,‚Äù she told Country Weekly magazine in 2007. ‚ÄúI would think about exactly how I was going to get there‚Äînot just how it would feel to be there.‚Äù

TaylorSwift,"For inspiration, the Beatles went to India, Paul Simon went to Africa - where should Taylor go?","Some of the greatest albums of all time came from finding inspiration from other cultures (though not always without some controversy).

Taylor likes to refresh and reinvent herself for her albums. So far it‚Äôs been country and pop and indie transitions. I thought it would be really interesting to dapple in different musical traditions. 

Brazilian folk music might be cool twist, blending African rhythms with European harmonic styles. 

Where does everyone think she could go to find fresh musical inspiration for her next albums?



Edit: this is about the musical theory elements of pulling inspiration from traditional music. Her talent is more than drama and breakups.

Edit: I am suggesting transculturism ‚Äúthe use of a culture‚Äôs symbols, artifacts, genres, rituals, or technologies by members of another culture.‚Äù

To have do something wrong, she would have had to show a lack of respect for those cultures.  I don‚Äôt see her doing this. Ever. 

The Beatles are an example of transculturation because they always showed great respect for black musicians, globalization played a large part in their success, and all music is inspired by something else.

TaylorSwift,What's your personal Album of the Year?,"2023 is almost over and we've been lucky enough to have *two* albums from Taylor, but also a lot of other great releases! Are Speak Now TV or 1989 TV your albums of the year? Do you even count them in your rankings as they're re-recordings? And what other albums have been changing your life this year?

For me, my #1 album of the year is Laugh Track by The National. I fell in love with it when it was surprised dropped (way more so than their other album this year), I listen to it every time I go on a long train/bus journey which it's somehow perfect for, and I thought it was so cool when Aaron Dessner talked about being inspired by Taylor to write and release spontaneously.

I certainly don't dislike Taylor, but I don't know nearly as much as my wife and sister in law.

I thought it would be cool to theme a question/round for each album... so maybe the debut album would just be trivia on her background - middle name, hometown etc...

Was thinking of using the questions for the Taylor Swift round on mastermind for one

I don't want it to be all trivia though.

TaylorSwift,Taylor and tarot: A thought experiment,"Yesterday (solstice, naturally) I started a year-long journey where I learn to read Tarot through pulling a card a day and journaling/meditating on its themes.

While I was reading through the symbolism of the major arcana (I am using the Builders of the Adytum deck, which you color yourself!) I thought about how each of the first ten keys could line up with Taylor's major studio albums in order. The following words are taken from the Biddy Tarot site:

0 (The Fool) - Debut: beginnings, innocence, spontaneity, a free spirit. Many lyrics themes center on these concepts, and on a practical level, this was also the beginning of her career as a recording artist. 

1 (The Magician) - Fearless: manifestation, resourcefulness, power, inspired action. Taylor was beginning to refine her craft and really coming into her power with this album. The themes are about diving head first into things because you are empowered to do so, both within and from others around you. 

2 (The High Priestess) - Speak Now: intuition, sacred knowledge, divine feminine, the subconscious mind. I think of Speak Now as one of the most - if not \*the\* most - feminine album of her discography. It's sweet, but intuitive, and it's a bit wiser than Debut or Fearless, but still full of lots of emotion that hasn't yet been put into focused creative center. 

3 (The Empress) - Red: femininity, beauty, nature, abundance. I like to think of Red as Taylor's era of taking her divine feminine intuition, natural wisdom, and creative energy and turning it into something real and natural and fully powerful. Red, to me, was Taylor's time of truly coming into her power.

4 (The Emperor) - 1989: authority, structure, establishment, a father figure. As 1989 heralded Taylor's time as the ""HBIC"" of pop, I think it's what made her a true authority and established figure in the music world and in the public consciousness at large. In this era, she was channeling her creative energy into getting bigger, more successful, and more influential than ever before. I think it may stand as her most masculine work to date.

5 (The Hierophant) - reputation: spiritual wisdom, religious beliefs, conformity, institutions. I like to think of Taylor's reputation era as a bit of the Hierophant reversed, or that she was being controlled by the ""religious"" beliefs of the celebrity world and cancel culture. Her biggest mistake was trying to conform to the institutions of stardom, such as making amends with Kanye just so she would be liked by a person who didn't care about her. (Listen to the Daily podcast episode ""The Year of Taylor Swift"" for more on this). However, through this process she gained a deeper, self-led wisdom that can never be taken from her and doesn't rely on authority or institutions. ""Don't Blame Me"" also has a gospel vibe and there are many religion-related concepts of sin, forgiveness, and rebirth throughout the album.

6 (The Lovers) - Lover: love, harmony, relationships, values alignment, choices. Aside from its obvious themes of love and partnership, Lover was also a time in which Taylor came into her own as a more politically outspoken star, with songs like ""The Man"" and ""You Need to Calm Down"" helping align and vocalize her choices and opinions. 

7 (The Chariot) - folklore: control, willpower, success, action, determination. I often think of the Chariot as fast decisions happening and consequences occurring in record time. folklore was her first ""surprise drop"" album and was developed over a short span of time during the first couple of months of the Covid-19 pandemic, despite the challenges of recording a collaborative album with several big stars during such a challenging time. Despite these challenges, it was a successful album for Taylor and helped put her ""back on the map"" both critically and commercially in a way that Lover had failed to do.

8 (Strength) - evermore: strength, courage, persuasion, influence, compassion. Many of the characters and vignettes in ""evermore"" speak to these themes, such as the strength and courage it takes to leave a painful relationship or to pick oneself up after betrayal in business, friendship, or love, and the compassion for self and others required to fully heal after such betrayals. 

9 (The Hermit) - Midnights: soul-searching, introspection, being alone, inner guidance. Midnights is Taylor's most directly ""retrospective"" album and centers on the thoughts that occur during the wee hours when one starts to review past loves, hurts, triumphs, heartbreaks, and regrets. Through these reflections, Taylor ultimately comes out with a stronger inner voice and sense of direction, though urging us not to use her as the only ""guiding light"" but to find that light within ourselves through our own retrospection.

10 (The Wheel of Fortune) - TS11?: good luck, karma, life cycles, destiny, a turning point. There's been plenty of chatter about the fortunate turn that Taylor's life has taken in the past year, both reputationally and romantically. Given its links to karma and the idea that good will come to those who work and wait for it, I can absolutely see TS11 incorporating many of the themes of the Wheel of Fortune.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think? Do you have any ideas for specific songs that go with certain minor arcana cards? For instance, I think Rebekah from tlgad absolutely fits the Queen of Pentacles energy, whereas Inez is Queen of Swords, Betty is the Queen of Cups, and Augustine is the Queen of Wands (big Leo energy).",0.7,13,0,13,Tiny_Jellyfish212,2023-12-22 22:36:56,18oplao,t3_18oplao
TaylorSwift,TS11 concept ‚ÄúDreamland‚Äù,"I actually made this album concept a couple years ago, in anticipation of TS10, based off of my ‚ÄúDreamland‚Äù theory.

Because it‚Äôs only after many sleepless nights, when you finally fall asleep, that you enter a world of fairytales and madness, blurring the lines between fiction and reality: you enter a dreamland. ‚ú®üõå‚ú®",0.89,116,0,116,FlubbyStarfish,2023-12-22 11:00:07,18obhtu,t3_18obhtu

Now, I'm gonna disclose how you voted, (well most of the votes are in secret, anyway, unless you disclosed them). As of the time this post is written, voting for Part 2 is closed.

**The voting results (and notes)**

* I don't know about you, but this poll is feeling that **22** people responded (including me, of course).
* By a(n unsurprising) *long shot*, Fearless won the most Fearless song in Fearless with a whopping 15 votes. (FYI, I voted for Love Story, for some reason...)
* There is a tie between Forever &amp; Always and Untouchable for most Midnights-y song in Fearless, with three votes each. You will be voting in yet another tiebreaker.
* You can now edit your responses (to make things easier and in case you change your mind).

TaylorSwift,Folklore love triangle‚Äîdo you include ‚ÄúThe 1‚Äù??,"Hey fellow Swifties! I had a random shower thought the other day and I‚Äôd be curious to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts. So, as we know there‚Äôs the (infamous? I know some people hate on it lol) fictitious love triangle in folklore surrounding Betty, James, and August/Augustine/Augusta***. This is clear in the songs throughout the album that narrate the situation- ‚ÄúCardigan‚Äù, ‚ÄúAugust‚Äù and ‚ÄúBetty‚Äù.  I usually think that ‚ÄúCardigan‚Äù is Betty‚Äôs POV, ‚ÄúAugust‚Äù is Augusta‚Äôs, and ‚ÄúBetty‚Äù is James‚Äô. However! I was listening to ‚ÄúThe 1‚Äù the other day and I feel like this one should belong! I feel like it could either be explained as Augusta looking back at the ‚Äúsummer fling‚Äù and acknowledging the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù aspects of the relationship with James. Alternatively, I could see it as being form Betty‚Äôs perspective before James apologizes or during the period when the two of them are not together and she‚Äôs remembering their love. Sonically and narratively, I feel like ‚ÄúThe 1‚Äù could also be Taylor‚Äôs way of setting the stage and introducing the love triangle to the listeners of the album, since it‚Äôs the first track we hear and foreshadows the story‚Äôs path. 

Do you think ‚Äúthe 1‚Äù belongs in the songs about the love triangle? I personally do but let me know your hot takes! 


Merry Swiftmas!!

TaylorSwift,I am looking at Taylor Swift's 2011 Speak Now World Tour and am shocked that she wasn't exactly selling out concerts like she would later in the decade.,"If you notice Seoul, South Korea look how there were only 4,725 tickets sold at the venue which had a capacity of 15,000. This was the only time Taylor ever traveled to South Korea and notice how Seoul is not part of her Eras Tour during the Asian leg next year.

I guess my question for OG Swifties is what was the situation with Taylor internationally back then? Was she really only huge and popular in America until the 1989 era?

TaylorSwift,Rate Taylor's Songs Scientific Study,"Hi All.I hope this post doesn't violate the rules of the sub. I am a data scientist and I am conducting research into the emotional perception of music. Specifically, Taylor Swift.

I have created two polls/questionnaires (links below) that contain all of Taylor's official release songs (not including remixes) where the user is asked to rate each song ranging from very sad to very happy. I have split the poll into two to try and avoid any fatigue when filling out a long form. As such, each poll has around 100 songs to rate. However, if you want to submit answers for both polls, that would be great. All help is appreciated!

My intention is to apply statistical and machine learning methods to this data to examine what factors are important in establishing the emotional tone of a song. I will be creating a blog-post to show the results (which I will come back and share in this sub) once everything is finished. Thanks in advance to anyone who participates!

(Also, if you spot any errors or mistakes (like duplicated songs) please let me know.

I was humming that song today for no reason. It suddenly hit me‚Ä¶ it was written by Taylor alongside Webber. I never took time to analyze the song in-depth, since I thought that it was associated to the context of the movie. *Now*, out of context, the song is a lyrical beauty. The way I interpret it, Beautiful Ghosts is about wanting to belong to a world that wasn‚Äôt meant for you and slowly accepting the one you‚Äôve known from the start.

TaylorSwift,What does ‚Äúscarlet letter‚Äù mean???,"So for years I‚Äôve been listening to Love Story and New Romantics and when the lines about the ‚Äúscarlet letters‚Äù come up, I‚Äôll just sort of wonder what it means and then move on. But since 1989TV release, I can‚Äôt get it out of my head. What on earth is a scarlet letter? 

At first I thought, after listening to Love Story‚Äôs ‚ÄúI was a scarlet letter‚Äù, that it was a reference to Romeo and Juliet the play. But then my overthinking started and I thought it was a way of saying she was a red flag (cause I thought she might‚Äôve been playing the damsel in distress card, what with all that crying on the staircase and being sorta depressed and not really doing anything about it‚Ä¶ yk?).

And then I heard New Romantics‚Äô ‚Äúwe show off our different scarlet letters‚Äù and that context didn‚Äôt fit any of my theories. So I‚Äôm just wondering what it means now.

TaylorSwift,What does being in each era mean for you?,"You know when someone says ""I'm in my \_\_\_ era"", what does each era mean to you? For me...

Being in your Debut era is when your love life is all over the place, maybe you're visiting your hometown, you're maybe being a bit naive or potentially unhinged. 

Being in your Fearless era is when you've maybe been in some toxic relationships, but you're young, you're free, you feel like you have all the time in the world, and at the end of the day you're optimistic for the future. And possibly a bit crazy...

Being in your Speak Now era is when you're a potentially naive hopeless romantic with big dreams who wears their heart on their sleeve and is eventually heartbroken (I thought I was in my 1989 era but actually this sounds a lot more like me...)

Being in your Red era is when you've had your heart broken more than it ever has been before and you go from being absolutely devastated to healing and getting over them by having fun with your friends and other people.

Being in your 1989 era is when you're learning to be more independent, your love life is all over the place, you're going through a big change and learning to adjust to it, whether that's moving to the big city, going through a breakup, finding new friends, whatever. And you're just gonna have fun!

Being in your reputation era is NOT when you're becoming a vengeful dark feminine energy girlboss, being in your reputation era is finding the strongest love in a time you thought you never could. You've gone through a tough time but you emerged ""doing better than I ever was"" with someone you're hopelessly in love with and connected to.

Being in your Lover era is settling into a long term relationship and starting to daydream about your wedding day realistically, but your insecurities and anxieties are still sitting in the back of your head about how they're going to leave you and that you're not good enough for them. (My reasoning for this is mostly Cornelia Street and Afterglow)

Being in your folklore era can be one of 2 things: either you have an extremely overactive imagination and spend your days away in another world daydreaming stories (me irl) OR you're going through a terrible heartbreak/mental health crisis.

Being in your evermore era is similar: either you're a girl/guy who lives in delusion, thinking up fake scenarios about your life, or you're beginning to process and heal from whatever it was in your folklore era that had you so depressed (but like you're still pretty damn hurt).

Being in your Midnights era is when you're thinking back to all the past times in your life and wondering what happened to your previous self and if that's still you. For when you're thinking back to times of crisis in your past and realising it either doesn't affect you anymore or it really wasn't that deep.

What era are you in? Do you think being in an era means something different to what I think? I think part of it depends on whether you're basing the era vibes off of the persona in the album or the person writing the album. Particularly with folkmore, being in your imagination with fake scenarios is more from the perspective of the person writing the album, while being depressed/recovering is the album narrator.",0.88,37,0,37,Mundane-Student7037,2023-12-20 13:43:11,18mtq6v,t3_18mtq6v
TaylorSwift,RANKED: G Tracks!,"Hi guys! It's me, u/itookyourmatches, and I'm back with the annual polls!

# [[RANK HERE]](https://strawpoll.com/ajnEO3BkkZW)

Today, we are ranking track that start with **the letter G**.

Note: For this section, I've decided that any song that starts with the word ""the"" will be treated as if ""the"" is not there. Taylor has a LOT of songs that start with ""T"" so this will help the spread a little. 

* Check the comments section for past polls, they stay open.
* Place your highest ranking at the top, and your lowest at the bottom.
* You can rank based off of which are your own personal favorites, or which tracks you consider to be objectively ""best"". Whatever you prefer.

2. Does the bridge intentionally allude to different albums/eras, as has been theorized? If so, why did you choose to do this?

TaylorSwift,Have yall ever created your own folklore/evermore tracklist?,"folklore and evermore are very story based as we all know, so I was wondering if yall have ever created your own story / timeline with your own tracklist.

Here‚Äôs mine:

foevermore:

1. the 1 - opening the story with ‚Äúit could‚Äôve been fun, if you would‚Äôve been the one‚Äù, the main character wonders what their story would‚Äôve been had they been together all this time, whether its a good or bad relationship

2. willow - the beginning of the relationship is when the MC goes for the person she wants. ‚Äúlife was a willow and it bent right to your wind‚Äù they find their way with each other and start dating for years and years

3. the last great american dynasty - they bought a house together and became the IT couple of the coastal town they found.

4. gold rush - the MC starts to fade away from ths daydream ‚Äúthe coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it. Cuz it fades into the gray of my day old tea‚Äù, slowly slipping away from the fantasy they had but trying theit best to reach out for what they want to truly believe in

5. my tears ricochet - ‚ÄúAnd I can go anywhere I want, anywhere I want just not home‚Äù, they want to go back to their fantasy which is what they consider home, but just cant hold onto to the fantasy any longer even though she keeps trying

6. tolerate it - ‚Äúnow im begging for footnotes in the story of your life‚Äù, the MC is trying to write footnotes, references, or mentions that could remind them of their fantasy relationship

7. august - ‚Äúaugust slipped away into a moment in time‚Äù, they finally realize its just been a fantasy this whole time and woke up from it because it has fully slipped away

8. champagne problems - in real life, they had to go thru an arranged marriage but decided to run from the alter and not continue on with their wedding

9. right where you left me (bonus) - the significant other of the main character felt abandoned and froze in time, never moving on from the alter ‚Äúim right where you left me‚Äù

10. tis the damn season - goes back to their parent‚Äôs house after all this fiasco and reminisces of their life and what could‚Äôve been ‚Äútime flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires now im missing your smile‚Äù, forever having a lingering feeling of this fantasy relationship they wish could‚Äôve been real

11. illicit affairs - ‚Äúyou taught me a secret language i cant speak with anyone else‚Äù

12. long story short - finally moving on with their life, they continue on just being another person in the society ‚Äúlong story short i survived‚Äù

Yea, overall I made such an emo story from what I imagine what could‚Äôve been i guessüò≠ Would loveeee to hear other stories too",0.97,23,0,23,sapphirewarlock,2023-12-20 07:04:44,18mnljf,t3_18mnljf

TaylorSwift,Why the Matty Healy's Comments on Black Women Matter (the GG ones in particular) and Why Taylor Swift Fans Should Care,"***Why the Ghetto Gaggers (GG) comments are bad and not like other sexual content and it is not just a kink***

Let’s start with abuse sexual content in general should be its separate discussion. Too many times, discussions that start off as talking about POC issues quickly devolve into larger conversations. And what starts as a safe space for POC to discuss their experiences, quickly gets overshadowed by these larger discussions and get drowned out by non-POC voices.

*Why is GG worse than sexual abuse content?*

It’s not about worse or better. It’s that GG in particular should be seen in a separate lens because of all the historical context behind it, particularly in America where the podcast with Matty Healy was recorded. To really discuss GG, we need to discuss the history of the sexualization and objectification of black women in America.

GG’s website caters towards white men “taming” black women through abuse and sexual/physical violence. The idea of taming black people, and especially women, has a clear connection with slavery in America and Europe. Africans and people of African descent were often called “wild” or “savages” in European and white American literature and media. The imagery of and putting black people in chains and being physically abused into submission is very much present in art and literature at the time. Black women were targets of sexual violence from white men during slavery. But as they were considered property, they did not have a justice system to protect them. After the civil war, violence towards black women by white men did not stop. Although former slaves were given freedom and thus US citizenship, they were not protected equally by the law. [In the South, no white man was ever convicted of rape of a black woman from the end of the Civil War to the 1960](https://jimcrowmuseum.ferris.edu/jezebel/index.htm)s. Even now, black women still experience higher rates of violence (from everywhere -- partners, strangers, friends, family, and acquaintances). Today, b[lack women and girls have higher rates of being victims of sexual violence.](https://www.rainn.org/news/many-black-survivors-reporting-raises-complicated-issues)

Additionally, besides violence, black women have to face sexualized stereotypes in-person and in media. B[lack women are burdened with the stereotype of the “Jezebel,” a black woman with an unstoppable sexual appetite.](https://jimcrowmuseum.ferris.edu/jezebel/index.htm)This stereotype has been used in minstrel shows and other media for white entertainment since slavery times. When television and movies became popular in the 20th century, black women were portrayed in sexualized ways with the rise of the “hoe” or “stripper” stereotype that implied black women were less pure, and more sexually available than their white counterparts. And before you come at me, yes white women have been portrayed in sex workers in movies but many times their portrayal is made so they are “saved” (i.e. Pretty Woman). Especially in music, black women are more likely to be called derogatory phrases or sexualized in lyrics and music videos.

GG feeds off these racist stereotypes and capitalizes on the years of “brutalization” and sexualization of black women for profit. This isn’t content just for sexual gratification for bondage or dominant acts, and it’s not just interracial content, it’s gratification of seeing black women subjected to racial abuse by white men. It’s continuing to feed into the racial injustice of black women and their fight against racism, sexualization, and pre-Civil War stereotypes.

[Medium’s investigation of the GG website found videos of actual references to black violence with uses of racial slurs and nooses in videos on the website.](https://medium.com/@abuseisnotporn/abuse-porn-or-sexual-assault-nsfw-cc1d49dd5529) So no, GG isn't just just any hardcore website and yes, the videos are in fact perpetrating racial violence. And it is a **very** niche website, it would be hard for someone not watching it to know about it and mention it casually. 

*It was just a comment, you're exaggerating.*

At the end of the day we don’t know what Matty feels in his heart behind closed doors. But let’s see the context of what was said during the podcast. Matty made several jabs at various racial and ethnic groups throughout the entire podcast. He especially made multiple jabs towards black women throughout the podcast, not just with the GG story. When told Ice Spice was a fan of his band, Matty made fun of Ice Spice (an upcoming black female artist). He called Ice Spice the “chubby Chinese lady” and an “Eskimo.” He made fun of Asian accents and laughed along when others did as well. He made fun of “fat black women” in a yoga class.

What we have is a rich white nepo baby man, feeling comfortable enough talking about him sexually gratifying himself to extremely racist content, bragging about doing it within 30 seconds of guests leaving his home, and knowing it was “brutalizating” black women, all this in a podcast full of “jokes” made at the expense of black women only three months ago.

*Why now? Is it only because of Taylor Swift you're taking about this?*

No. Black and other POC women and creators have been calling this website out since forever, they are constantly fighting these stereotypes, they have been calling on Matty Healy to apologize since the podcast premiered. The only difference is Taylor has been giving him a bigger platform now with letting him perform in her concerts, seating him in VIP, and walking with him in pap walks. Now people are listening.

*It was just a joke or satire or a persona!*

Racism isn't a joke. POC should not be the butt of any joke. If you have to put down an entire group of people to be funny, that's not comedy, that's sad and gross. Yes, he made some political statements before, maybe they were even good, but that doesn't overshadow the harm he is doing to POC people.  People can mean well and still offend people. If he wants to support POC causes, instead of speaking on behalf of marginalized groups he should be elevating POC voices that are speaking on these issues. At the end of the day, the group affected by the jokes get to decide if they found it offensive and if they accept his apology (if it ever happens). And by the way, Ice Spice has never accepted his apology regarding his comments on her, so no it doesn't count that he ""apologized to her.""

*Well I'm only interested in the music and not her personal life. Or her personal life shouldn't matter.*

Matty and Taylor's behavior and silence on this not affecting you means you are privileged to not be affected. POCs don't have that luxury. There are many POC swifties at her concerts, in this subreddit, and engaging with Taylor's music who are personally affected by Matty's pattern of behavior and comments (including the GG comments). By disregarding his actions, you are disregarding their lives and their feelings. POC fans matter too, they deserve to feel heard and safe. Imagine going to a concert as a POC and not knowing how many people in a crowd of 70k support his behavior (or Taylor's for being silent and supporting it by bringing him to concerts) or think it doesn't matter. Would you be able to exchange bracelets with someone not knowing if they think his GG comments were fine? By dismissing their voices, you are contributing to creating, at best an uncomfortable environment, at worst an unsafe environment for POC swifties.",0.81,7644,0,7644,f_scott_fishgerald,2023-05-17 22:41:28,13kdg2w,t3_13kdg2w

Speak Now (Taylor's Version) has been announced for release July 7, 2023:

It fills me with such pride and joy to announce that my version of Speak Now will be out July 7 (just in time for July 9th, iykyk 😆) I first made Speak Now, completely self-written, between the ages of 18 and 20. The songs that came from this time in my life were marked by their brutal honesty, unfiltered diaristic confessions and wild wistfulness. I love this album because it tells a tale of growing up, flailing, flying and crashing… and living to speak about it. With six extra songs I’ve sprung loose from the vault, I absolutely cannot wait to celebrate Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) with you on July 7th.  💜💜💜

TaylorSwift,PSA: Don't judge a fan for sitting at a concert.,"I saw a TikTok the other day of someone filming fans on tour who were sitting and not standing like everyone else around them. The gist of the video and comments were, ""They're not that into it like the rest of us; they're not real fans."" 

I've been a fan of Taylor for thirteen-ish years, and I have POTS. It's a condition that is a type of orthostatic intolerance, meaning, in short: I can't stand for a three-hour concert. I will feel like absolute shit, get dizzy, and almost pass out if I stand for too long. I will HAVE to sit at my upcoming concert. 

Hell, I'm even thinking about getting an IV saline bag beforehand so I can have a better time and be more comfortable. I WISH I could stand the entire time with my friends, but I know even with the IV that I will still need to sit. 

So, please, don't judge fans who are sitting at your concert. You don't know if they have an invisible illness. They are not ""fake fans"" for sitting.

TaylorSwift,Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) full prologue,"When I look back at the Speak Now album, I get a lump in my throat. I have a feeling it will always be this way, because this period of time is so violently aglow with the last light of the setting sun of my childhood. I made this album, completely self-written, between the ages of 18 and 20. I’ve spoken about how I feel like those ages are the most emotionally turbulent ones in a person’s life. Maybe when I say that, I’m really just talking about myself.

I think they might just be the most idealistic, hopeful years too. At this point of my life, I had released my second album, Fearless. It became the breakthrough moment I’d always dreamt of, one that catapulted my career to new realms of success. It had brought with it a tidal wave of pressures and pitfalls and growing pains. All the while, I was encountering the pressures and pitfalls of normal teenage growth. I had cataclysmic crushes and brushes with heartache. I moved out of my parents’ house and set my bags down in a new apartment. I hung photos on my own walls and decorated the space where I would sob and cackle and shatter and dream. Sometimes I felt like a grown up, but a lot of the time I just wanted to time travel back to my childhood bed, where my mom would read stories to me until I fell asleep. 

In my darker moments, I was tormented by the doubt that swirled loudly around my ascent and my merits as an artist. I was trying to create a follow up to the most awarded country album in history, while staring directly into the face of intense criticism. I had been widely and publicly slammed for my singing voice and was first encountering the infuriating question that is unfortunately still lobbed at me to this day: does she really write her songs? 
Spoiler: I really, really do. 

In the years since, I have developed a thicker skin about public criticism and the cynicism with which people approach the music I make. At that time, it leveled me. I had these voices in my head telling me that I had the perfect chance and I blew it. I hadn’t been good enough. I had given it all I had and been found wanting. 

I wanted to get better, to challenge myself, and to build on my skills as a writer, an artist, and a performer. I didn’t want to just  be handed respect and acceptance in my field, I wanted to earn it. To try and confront these demons, I underwent extensive vocal training and made a decision that would completely define this album: I decided I would write it entirely on my own. I figured, they couldn’t give all the credit to my cowriters if there weren’t any. But that posed a new challenge: It really had to be good. If it wasn’t, I would be proving my critics right. 

I had no idea how much this pain would shape me. This was the beginning of my series of creative choices made by reacting to setbacks with defiance. That my stubbornness in the face of doubters and dissenters would become my coping mechanism through my entire career from that point forward. This exact pattern of enacting my own form of rebellion when I feel broken is exactly why you’re reading these very words, and I’m re-releasing this album now. 

I went though my first worldwide scandal (the mic-grab seen around the world). I experienced the weirdness of trying to get to know a boy while a swarm of paparazzi surrounds the car. Media contacting my publicist for an official statement on why two teenagers broke up. These are weird experiences to have at any age, but even more surreal when you’re 19. 

I had the nagging sense that in the most intense moments of my life, I had frozen. I had said nothing publicly. I still don’t know if it was out of instinct, not wanting to seem impolite, or just overwhelming fear. But I made sure to say it in all these songs. I decided to call the album Speak Now. It was a play on the “speak now or forever hold your peace” moment in weddings, but for me it symbolized a chance to respond to the chatter and commentary around my own life. 

Some of these emotional revelations were surprising to people. Some expected anger and instead got compassion with “Innocent”.  Some expected a kiss-off breakup song but instead got a hand-on-heart apology, “Back to December”. It was an album that was the most precious to me because of its vast extremes. It was unfiltered and potent. In my mind, the saddest song I’ve ever written is “Last Kiss”. My most scathing is “Dear John” and my most wistfully romantic is “Enchanted”. 

I’ll be forever proud of setting a goal and seeing it through. I’ll always feel shivers all over when I remember signing “Long Live” to close the show every night on tour. The outstretched hands of those bright and beautiful faces of the fans. Their support was like an open palm that reached out and helped me up off the ground when others were frankly, mean.  

These days I make my choices for those people, the ones who thought I had been good enough all along. I try to speak my mind when I feel strongly, in the moment I feel it. I’m still idealistic and earnest about the music I make, but I’m less crushed when people mock me for it. I know now that one of the bravest things a person can do is create something with unblinking sincerity, and put it all on the line. I still sometimes wish I was a little kid again in a tiny bed, before I ever grew up. 

I always looked at this album as my album, and the lump in my throat expands to a quivering voice as I say this. Thanks to you, dear reader, it finally will be.

I consider this music to be, along with your faith in me, the best thing that’s ever been mine.

Yours,

TaylorSwift,Thank you from a swiftie dad,"I’m a very proud “swiftie dad” to my 13 year old stepdaughter. She is OBSESSED with all things Taylor, talks about her all day every day, sings her songs constantly, already has her Speak Now TV vinyl preordered, and she’s going to one of the Minneapolis shows next month with her mom. She also went to a concert during her reputation tour. I joined this subreddit just so I could see Taylor news in my feed, and I just want to extend a thank you to all you die-hard fans for all the topics and talking points you’ve provided. My daughter’s face lights up like you wouldn’t believe when I start dropping knowledge or asking if she’s heard the same rumors, etc. I’ve always had a very close relationship with her, but this has just enhanced that connection so much and I love it. So thank you, all of you, for being such a wonderful fan base. I’m glad she’s a part of it.

Update: I told my wife about the stunning number of upvotes and amazing replies from all you fellow swifties, and she told my daughter to read through it all, too. She loves it, and this just reinforces for her how amazing Taylor fans really are. I got a pretty tight hug out of it too, so thank you all again for being such a gift.

TaylorSwift,Is anyone kinda sick of hearing about Taylor’s life?,"Okay I need to preface this, I adore Taylor. She’s been my favourite artist for well over a decade plus. I was first introduced to her on MySpace, I went to see her open for Rascal Flats and every concert tour since then. This is not a criticism of her at all, more like the culture.

But I’m sick of hearing about her everyday in the news. I’m sick of hearing about her and Travis Kelce all over the news. Every day I get news stories about these two and I just don’t care anymore, if I ever did at all.  There’s so many news stories about so many mundane things. “Taylor attends football game!” “Taylor and Travis seen holding hands!” “Taylor drank wine during halftime!” “Taylor meets Travis Kelce Mother!” “Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s parents to meet!”

It’s just so exhausting. I understand that celebrity culture is always going to be a thing and right now she’s pretty much the biggest musician in the world, but I just don’t want to hear about every mundane facet of her life in a big news story anymore. Is anyone else with me that they just start getting annoyed when they see yet another news story about her?",0.89,4852,0,4852,king-geass,2023-11-16 05:39:58,17we893,t3_17we893

TaylorSwift,Project Marjorie is too far..,"So in one of the nights in Nashville a bunch of the fans in the floor seats decided to hold up pictures of Taylor’s grandmother, Marjorie. There was another night when people held up their phone lights and I think that she actually liked and appreciated since Taylor Nation was retweeting and sharing it, but they didn’t say anything about the pictures. I’m sure that doing that came from a place of love and who ever decided to start that at the show didn’t mean any bad intentions… but holding up pictures of her grandmother is too far and too personal for her and don’t think that should become a trend at future tour nights.

Edit: after finding out the girl who printed all the pictures put her tik tok username on all the pictures it seems to me all she wanted to do was get credit for getting an emotional reaction out of Taylor..",0.95,4742,0,4742,SheeDoesntEvenGoHere,2023-05-09 00:36:27,13c7a9o,t3_13c7a9o

TaylorSwift,Parasocial relationships,"Y’all I’m sorry but why are we all mourning this relationship as if we’re the ones that dumped/got dumped? 

We can be glad it happened without being like “time to listen to happiness now :,,,(((“ or “I guess everything she did wasn’t enough”.

It’s so weirdly pretentious too, especially the comments of “we’re going to get through this” and the like. Get through what? It’s not our relationship and it never was. 

This is NOT intended to be mean or hurtful, six years is a long time to be with someone but come on, things end all the time. Be glad they say it was amicable and not dramatic, be glad there aren’t any cheating allegations from Joe. Be hopeful that the media storm that takes over their relationship is the least invasive possible (it probably won’t be but we can hope).

I also don’t get the people who are like “this changes so much of her discography for me” like why? She wrote love songs about other people before while dating them and they aren’t dating anymore… why do you think it’s different now?

I really don’t intend for this to be hateful or hurtful, I just genuinely don’t understand why this is a such a big deal. If someone can offer perspective on why her music is now changed for them, I’m all for listening because I really don’t get it.

I hope Taylor is enjoying herself on tour and hope that both of them and their loved ones are all alright! Breakups can be hard, I think talking about it makes it harder when it’s an overload like this.

TaylorSwift,The Electric Lady Studios video has really thrown things into perspective. I finally understand why Taylor isn't speaking up about politics lately.,"***I want to say before my post that no, I don't condone her dating Matt Healy. He's a toxic person who certainly has thrown a lot of Taylor's past ""good"" actions into question. Rather, I want to focus on why I believe she's been so silent regarding political issues lately. TW for mass shootings, racism, white-extremism, transphobia, and misogyny.***

***There are no Eras Tour spoilers in this post.***

Like all of you, I've been really disappointed about Taylor refraining from speaking out about politics lately. To be frank, it makes her old activism appear very performative - especially when coupled with the whole Matty Healy fiasco. To hear her silent on subjects like mass shootings, economic crisis, LGBTQIA+ issues, and the transphobic legislation passing in red states (ESPECIALLY Tennessee) is, for lack of better words, enraging. Because of this, it's very fair to be upset that she won't use her platform(s) of millions of followers to speak up and call out these issues. However, I have to admit that as of lately, I'm starting to understand why she hasn't.

The footage of her leaving Electric Lady Studios while dozens if not hundreds of ""fans"" are crowding and chasing her car has really thrown things into perspective for me, and because of that, I'm able to empathize with her silence now.

We as fans and normal people cannot for the life of us even imagine nor comprehend the level of fame that Taylor is at. There is no doubt that she is the most famous musician in the world right now, and with that comes an inordinate amount of people who do not like her and perpetuate misogynistic and hateful ideas of her. Radical right-leaning websites such as Breitbart boast articles and comment sections that slew hateful, sexist, transphobic, and downright disturbing thoughts about Taylor and her music. YouTubers for The Daily Wire such as Candance Owens spread harmful and sexist misinformation about Taylor that can easily fall into the hands of the wrong person. Because of this, Taylor must tread very carefully in regards to what she can and cannot say - not just for her sake, but for the sake of us fans, too.

There is no doubt that over the last few years the amount of mass shootings in America has skyrocketed. According to the ADL (Anti-Defamation League), in 2022 alone, White Supremacists and related branches of extremism made up all extremist motivated mass shootings.

It is worth noting as well that the deadliest shooting on American soil occurred in Las Vegas on October 1st, 2017, at an ***outdoor concert venue*** via sniper hiding in the upper levels of a hotel room. Taylor is not ignorant of this fact, as in her 2019 article with Elle titled *30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30*, Taylor reveals her biggest fear is just that:

&gt;""*After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I’ve ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things.""*

Because of this, I feel very strongly that it is not safe for Taylor or her team to speak out about political issues right now. It is of my opinion that speaking out on these issues while on her American leg of the tour might spark a very dangerous backlash from the alt-right. I've seen the concern of shootings at shows pop up on this subreddit and a few others on multiple occasions so I know that the concern is very real. Upon witnessing the video at Electric Lady Studios - where ""fans"" are within arms length of her SUV - I realized that it is very easy for someone with a grudge against Taylor to retaliate, and I can see how she would avoid upsetting the right to protect herself and her fans for the time being.

While the Matty situation calls her previous political activism into question, this is why I believe she has not spoken up on political issues lately. I don't think she will either until the International leg of the tour or until its completion.",0.76,3939,0,3939,im_a_throwaway_hoe,2023-05-23 18:48:57,13ptxyi,t3_13ptxyi

TaylorSwift,"Fans need to stop chasing Taylor’s car, and showing up to her studio.","This isn’t aimed at this sub as a one and only, but I hope the word gets passed around. Ever since she’s been back in New York and it gets pictured, crowds of fans are gathering and waiting outside the studio she’s working in. Today they waited 5 hours just to get a fleeting glimpse of her but not only that they’re running across traffic like actual idiots and it can lead to potentially a bad accident happening.

[Now they’re also chasing the car on her way home and stalking her. She has a private garage but even they’re invading the entrance to that too](https://twitter.com/midnightstrack2/status/1660819940239360001) she doesn’t even look comfortable with this. She looks like she’s panicking.

This isn’t cute behaviour. This ain’t funny. Just because she’s a public celebrity and doesn’t mind attention doesn’t mean she’s a zoo animal. Fans are putting her in danger and not acting rational. This is not normal. Video taping her as well for Tik Tok views and acting psychotic isn’t brag worthy.

Fans need to stop. If you see fans doing this, please call this behaviour and nip it on the butt before something bad happens. Even her security aren’t having a good time with it either.

Imagine if you were her and you had people running on the road, tapping on the window, screaming and stalking you.

She has so many stalkers too that this happens the more likely reminder something bad could happen.

TaylorSwift,I feel so bad for Taylor,"Context for those who don’t know:
Taylor was recorded entering a restaurant in NJ, presumably for Jack’s wedding this weekend. Hours later, hundreds of people had gathered outside hoping for a glimpse of her. There is another video of Taylor stepping out, politely waving as she made her way to the car. I don’t want to share myself as it made me deeply uncomfortable, however it is easy enough to find online if you want to see. 

She has mentioned before how her life is not normal, that it is frightening to be treated that way. She has no way of knowing who is out there, who is safe to be around and who would want to do her harm. I imagine she must also feel guilt/embarrassment that wherever she goes, even when the day is meant to be about her friends, it is always made about her in the end. It isn’t her fault, but she knows she is, “too big to hang out,” and I don’t doubt she blames herself on some level when something like this happens. I envy her money and some of the lifestyle she gets to live, but I wouldn’t trade places. The videos reminded me of zoo animals. No living being deserves to be poked and prodded for the entertainment of others, animal or human. How isolating, anxiety-inducing, and depressing an existence like this must be.

I wonder if she misses the level of fame she had prior to 1989. She was successful and well-known with more money than she could have ever spent, but her life wasn’t as out of control as it is now. Tiktok and the tour have compounded the craziness even further. I’m genuinely heartbroken as I contemplate what she must have been feeling tonight.",0.88,3574,0,3574,starsdoyulikedem,2023-08-19 04:54:47,15v4d1k,t3_15v4d1k

“Being a consummate optimist, I assumed I could fix this if I simply changed my behavior. I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn’t sensationalize or sexualize that—right?

TaylorSwift,Stadium employee told me to “prioritize my health over seeing Taylor Swift”.,"Got told to “prioritize my health over coming to see Taylor Swift”

Vent ahead as I’m still really upset. 

While I was waiting in the shade sitting on my rollater outside Levi’s Stadium before the Taylor Swift concert this weekend a stadium employee told me sometimes it’s important to “prioritize my health over Taylor Swift” when I was inquiring about ADA accommodations. Insinuating that disabled people don’t deserve to come to concerts if they can’t stand for the full concert I guess. I was livid, my friend who was with me was aghast. After then being moved to the ADA line (in full sun, for 40 minutes) and fighting through crowds to find a tiny kiosk hidden behind a mob of people trying to buy merch I was in tears by the time I found the right person to talk to who was fortunately able to get me accessible seats. I just wanted a seat where I could see sitting down without having to climb stairs if I needed to use the restroom. You can see my heart rate while I’m sitting down!

Then literally every 30-45 minutes for the entire concert employees were coming up wanting to hear about my experience. I finally went off into a quiet room with one for a half hour to explain what had happened in the hopes that people would leave me alone and let me enjoy the freaking concert! I missed the end of folklore and all of 1989, just making it back in time for the surprise songs. 

On the one hand, I’m glad Levi’s Stadium took that employees comment seriously and wanted to talk to me/get it up the food chain, but on the other hand….I spent an hour with my eyes not on Taylor. And after the effort it took to get tickets, get ready, get to the stadium, and get to our seats, it SUCKS to have missed so much of the concert because some asshole employee didn’t think I should be there.

I’ve already seen people trying to take the lyrics to several songs (particularly Vampire and Grudge) to further the “Olivia and Taylor hate each other” narrative. 

This is the exact thing people have done to Taylor for years on end. Taking her lyrics and using it to create a story around her life like it’s a fanfic. 

It seems very clear to me that these songs are not about Taylor (or Hayley Williams) as much as they are about relationships, growing up, and the Disney Kid to Superstar arc. 

Did Taylor’s team and Olivia’s team have some sort of legal dispute around Deja Vu? Yeah, probably. But is that the defining moment of Olivia or Taylor’s careers? No. Let the girls do their thing.",0.92,3059,0,3059,swiftiegarbage,2023-09-08 18:52:37,16dfqk2,t3_16dfqk2

TaylorSwift,"""I saw both the Eras and Renaissance Tours....""","[https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-beyonce-tour-concerts-one-was-once-in-lifetime-2023-6?inline-endstory-related-recommendations=](https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-beyonce-tour-concerts-one-was-once-in-lifetime-2023-6?inline-endstory-related-recommendations=)

This is the article the man posted, the one who got badly harrassed online by Swifties. 

My goodness. There is nothing in this article that can be interpreted badly. He simply said that Beyonce had set out to perform one album to the max, while Taylor was trying to do justice to an entire genre-spanning career, of course Beyonce's show is better paced and themed. Beyonce is also easily one of the best performers of all time. He also said that he liked the Eras Tour, but it felt like a celebration of Taylor's journey, while the Renaissance Tour was a celebration of queer culture, and he found the second one more moving as a queer person himself.

He faced homophobic slurs, death threats, danger to his loved ones and an attempt to get him fired, because he dared to say a few words against Taylor. Jesus.

Swifties (the insane ones) need to learn that the entire world does not need to have the exact same taste as them, and Taylor is not some kind of goddess who needs to be worshipped. I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but I felt the need to highlight just how normal this article was. He said nothing. 'They're both great but I like Beyonce better' is not an insult. 

Goddamn. I almost think we deserve the title of the worst fanbase on the internet.",0.92,2744,0,2744,AccomplishedKale795,2023-06-22 21:46:49,14gcyk5,t3_14gcyk5

TaylorSwift,Swifties…you were right all along. She is the GOAT. This is coming from a non-fan who went to her show. ***spoilers***,"First off, let me say that I am NOT in the demographic that goes to Taylor Swift concerts. I’m a middle-aged dad who took his daughter to Chicago to check out the show. I also happen to be a musician who has played on stage over twenty years semi-professionally, so I know a thing or two about performance. Taylor Swift is, hands down, the GOAT. I have been to and seen many concerts and shows in various arenas, and Friday night at Soldier Field had to be the best concert experience of my life. She went for 46 songs without a break (she did two more songs for us than normal apparently…as a drummer, I would have had to tap out at 25 songs), changed outfits 28 times, had ten different themes for each album, and switched instruments throughout the show, to say nothing of her dancing. She filled up every corner of that stadium. She was radiant. The crowd was on her side, and she was there for them (it was the start of pride month, and a gay couple a few rows over proposed…I believe they said “yes”:) Technically, the show was brilliant. I have never in my life seen better audio/visual integration and lighting, not to mention the pyrotechnics. Through it all, she never tired or lost her edge. She was as fresh by the end of Karma as she was at the start of Shake it Off. Not quite sure how she pulled off that dive trick from one end of the stage to the other, but that was crazy. The way she incorporated the incredible digital screen displays with physical reality defied my senses. It wasn’t a show, and it wasn’t a movie or a musical; it was something else, some new kind of 4D experience that creates an emotional resonance beyond the music. And the fans? You are the best people on the earth. You were kind to my daughter, lifting her up to get a better look at the merchandise and giving her friendship bracelets, even though you didn’t know her. There was a massive, scary crush as people tried to get out of the stadium complex, but at no time did I feel rushed or that we would be trampled. Everyone was just…happy. 
So, to all the haters and critics: see her live. There is no lip syncing or fakery. She is the real deal and I would see her in concert again.

Edit: I thought they wouldn’t let me post this here so I copied and made it a comment on the Chicago show thread. Sorry for the duplication.",0.9,2702,0,2702,slavabien,2023-06-06 16:28:54,142hv25,t3_142hv25

TaylorSwift,Timeline &amp; Wellness Check,"It's been an interesting month in the fandom \[understatement of the decade\], so this is a quick update and wellness check. How are we all doing?

Here's a summary of events for those that have missed the fast paced shifting storylines on both social and mainstream media over the last month. Take it lightly as intended and remember, she's a megastar and I have $13 in the bank \[See what I did there?\]. We are not the same but i am a swiftie through the good and wildly funny times:

1/ April 8th - Entertainment Tonight break the news that Taylor and Joe have broken up. \[Tragic, I know. A moment of silence for the Toe stans\] [Source](https://www.etonline.com/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-break-up-after-six-years-of-dating-exclusive-202408)

2/ April 10th - People magazine, the go-to for Taylors PR team confirms the news and provides more details. [Source](https://people.com/music/why-taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-broke-up-after-six-years-exclusive/)

3/ The fandom devolves into chaos, many relating it to being the children of divorce. \[Yes, I'm being serious. No, I'M not being serious.. THEY are being serious.\] [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12gcp30/love_is_not_dead_please_dont_let_breakup_rumors/) [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12ho7o1/inside_taylor_swift_and_joe_alwyns_differences/)

4/ Speculation starts on how she will move forward. [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12gi1nd/if_the_breakup_is_real_how_do_you_think_taylor/?sort=top)

5/ The Sun alleges that they were buying a mansion together before the sudden split. \[allegedly\] [Source](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/22052803/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-buying-mansion-before-breakup/)

6/ April 19th and Emma Lairds ""Moments in March"" post. \[It gets messier\] - With some swifties in stage 2 of their grief over mother and father breaking up, they start their internet 'investigations' into his co-star. She had posted a buried photo of him with a scooter which the more unhinged fans thought was a pointed statement of him supporting Scooter Braun. \[I can't make this stuff up\]  [X](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/emma-laird-shares-photo-of-joe-alwyn-after-taylor-swift-split/)

7/ April 20th was ""thumbsupgate"" - A fan in the crowd at the Tampa show held up a sign that asked if she was ok. \[Her apparent reply? .. A thumbs-up\]  [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/12qh1o6/a_closer_look_at_the_thumbs_up_moment/)

How are you doing? You are almost up-to-date.. just 3 more key events and they are quick and confusing. Sorry I won't be able to help you process them because our Queen is in her messy Era.

8/ May 3rd The Sun break another story \[They're on a roll\] - Taylor is dating The 1975 frontman Matty Healy [X](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/22241851/taylor-swift-dating-matty-healy/)

9/ May 4th The Sun doubles down and says not only are they dating but they will be confirming their relationship by firstly, him attending her concert but also that there will be some form of PDA. While the PDA was not as expected they did both mouth words during each of their concerts to each other. \[I'll attach a cosmo article about it because that's how 'stranger than fiction' this is getting, you need to see it to believe it.\] [Source](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/22254438/taylor-swift-matty-healy-confirm-secret-relationship/) [X](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a43818052/taylor-swift-mattt-healy-mouthing-each-other-secret-messages-during-concerts/)

10/ The entire fandom devolves into panic, denial and confusion with again 'internet investigators' this time on a mission to determine weather Matthew Timothy Healy is worthy of our Supreme Leader. \[Yes, I know it's starting to sound like a cult but I swear it was never like this back when she dated Hiddl.. Sorry I digress\]  [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/13bw3fh/taylor_swift_and_matty_healy_like_each_other_were/) [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1398j11/matty_healy_is_spotted_at_tonights_concert/) [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/139g0w8/just_because_matt_healy_is_at_her_show_doesnt/)

Oh and one last thing, at some point during the chaos some people thought Matty kissed Phoebe Bridgers on stage in Nashville but it was just the angle of the video and ended up being a cheek kiss.

There. You're all caught up.

TaylorSwift,"Football fan here, coming in peace. I lost a bet, and need your guidance","I am a Broncos fan and Travis Kelce's Chiefs have beaten us 16 games in a row. With our upset win over them tonight, I have lost a bet. I said that since Taylor isn't at the game, if we win I'll listen to every album she has ever put out and review every song - with maximum effort.

Here's where I need your help: first, where is the definitive list of her albums? Second, where's the best place to listen? (I don't have Spotify but will sign up if it's the only option) Third, what is the Taylors version thing and do those count as separate albums? Finally, are there any songs that aren't on albums but that I should include?

Thank you for your help and for having us football fans as guests when Taylor attends games!

Edit: if a song has a music video, I will be including it in the songs review. I could definitely use help with which songs have videos, but I already feel pretty needy with my requests so far, haha.

Edit 2: my God you people are wonderful. I'll post results to the subreddit, potentially album by album depending on my pace. Thank you again for all your help",0.92,2681,0,2681,Alex_Demote,2023-10-30 00:16:01,17jfgl9,t3_17jfgl9

TaylorSwift,I made Taylor’s Floral Grammys Dress (my version),"I wanted to recreate Taylor’s Grammys dress for the Eras tour but I ended up making it more my style with a babydoll dress pattern! I wanted similar shoes to hers but I didn’t want to wear heels to a 3 hour concert so I was excited when I found cute pink flats that tied around like hers! 

Bonus pic of my eras nails! And cat. 

I posted this in r/sewing so I figured I’d paste all the info I typed out. I’ll post the links in the comments! 

I bought the fabric from AliExpress and I chose the “apricot mesh” fabric.

You can also buy it on Etsy, just search “3D floral fabric”

For the lining, I just bought silky lining fabric that matched the closest from Joann.

I used the Capulet Dress Pattern. It was a great pattern to follow, the directions show you how to do the lining and I found it very easy to understand! I just saw on her instagram she’s having a sale for 30% off using the code SPRING

Also, I used sleeves from the Mccalls M7946 pattern because I wanted them longer and a little less poofy. I just cut out the sleeves from M7946 and then followed the directions from the Capulet pattern because they’re pretty much the same sleeve just different sizes.",0.98,2602,0,2602,melissallaneous107,2023-04-27 23:06:54,1316yrx,t3_1316yrx

TaylorSwift,Can we stop reducing the 1989 era down to her ED?,"The 1989 era (as Taylor herself has said) changed her life in so many ways, and for the better. She was easily on top of the world and it could be said that she seemed to have it all. She was still riding the success of being an incredible country music star while making a daring shift into pop music and shocking the world when she did it brilliantly. She would not be anything like who she is today if that era hadn’t happened. 

That being said, it makes me sad to see people reducing the entire era and all it did for her down to the fact that she was struggling with her self image. It was a terrible thing, yes, but if I was Taylor, I would be hurt to know that my ED is the only part of that era that my fans even remember or ever talk about. Taylor was not entirely miserable during that era. She was overwhelmed by love and support and it showed her just how far she could go as a musician, and how much it pays off to take creative risks now and then. 

It was a beautiful era and it was the first concert I ever attended. She put her heart and soul into that album and tour, and that is what we should be recognizing right now.",0.92,2574,0,2574,[deleted],2023-08-12 10:50:10,15ozcv9,t3_15ozcv9

TaylorSwift,Taylor Swift’s final Thank You post of 2023 to Brazil,"“Bringing a tour to Brazil has been something I've dreamt of for years, and those fans blew my expectations away. We've officially wrapped up the 2023 Eras Tour and we got to end the year with 6 shows in Rio and São Paulo, with the most magical crowds. I'm so grateful to my touring family, my band, crew and dancers for everything they put into this show all year. To the people who came to see it, you are what made those stadiums feel so alive and electric and unforgettable for me. Really just feeling so proud and moved by what I got to be a part of. See you in 2024 🎤🎸🎹✨”",0.91,2533,0,2533,IngrownThighHairs,2023-11-28 22:34:49,1867g3m,t3_1867g3m
TaylorSwift,"As a trans person, Lavender Haze makes me really happy.","I'm a trans person living in the UK. If you aren't familiar with politics on TERF island, just look up ""UK trans"" and you should get an idea. It's the most toxic environment for trans people I have ever seen in a first-world country. The UK is almost being split apart since last week because of the government's recent decision to block the Scottish gender reform bill. Waiting lists for trans medical care are upwards of 5 years by sheer political red tape. Anti-trans laws are also currently sweeping across much of the US these days, especially in the South. Things are grim.

And now, suddenly, we have Taylor Swift, the world's biggest pop star, dropping a video off arguably her biggest album, featuring a trans model as her love interest. And not just that, the party scene has many very visibly trans people right behind her. It's not even advertised, nor is it a big part of the video's central message or brand, like it was for YNTCD. But it's definitely being noticed and talked about, because Taylor Swift. Lots of trans people are just *there* in this video. Not in the background, they're front and centre. Around the biggest pop star.

TaylorSwift,Remembering reputation era for what it actually was,"With the recent positivity and excitement toward reputation TV I figured it was worth giving a shout out to how the OG era was and the fans who were there at the time.

This was not a fun badass pop diva era. For fans it was relief after a massive years long creative drought and relief that she was okay after the worst year of her career/life. No one knew she had Joe by her side until May 2017, 3 months before the album dropped. So from July 2016 to then, we had no clue if she was doing ok or if anyone actually had her back (aside from the standards like her family/Abigail etc), much less that she’d found a long term partner. 

The industry had basically washed their hands of her and artists often commented negatively on how her music was “out” now and she had lost all her popularity. 

The last thing that happened before the album rollout was literally the sexual assault trial. She won the case August 14 and wiped her socials on August 18, 2017. 

Look What You Made Me Do was crucified until the video premiered. The general attitude was that she’d lost her talent and she was doing robotic mindless pop now. People made fun of her “trying to be badass”. They said the dance scene was copying Beyoncé’s formation video. When she released a cover of September, Twitter said it was cultural appropriation. When she announced the stadium tour, the media was certain it would flop. Even when they had to eat their words they did it with an air of “well I was still right about the album being terrible”. We know now critics were told by their editors to give it low ratings. 

And when she tweeted she’d had a pleasant end to the year at the end of 2017, she was blasted for that too. Because if everyone else is suffering you can’t be happy of course. 

It was still a gloomy time to be a fan despite her return to music. No one took this album seriously and most wrote it off after hearing ready for it. I’m glad the attitude has turned around but I haven’t forgotten the past either.",0.93,2508,0,2508,Glitteryskiess,2023-11-28 03:45:27,185ljou,t3_185ljou

TaylorSwift,"Love is not dead, please don’t let breakup rumors interfere with your relationship","Let me start this by saying: I‘m as shocked as many of you are and if the breakup rumors really are true, this is one of the celebrity breakups that will hit different.

But: There are a lot of comments about how love is dead and about how lover and invisible string can’t be your wedding songs anymore.

So, please take this as a reminder that 

a) love is not dead. It still exists and it pretty obviously existed for Taylor and Joe. Love does not have to be forever to be real.

b) the fact that they might have broken up does not invalidate the meaning or feeling of any song. She wrote it. She recorded it. She performed it many, many times, because she felt it. It is real and it is a beautiful capture of a wonderful feeling she had.

c) Taylor wants her fans to connect to her songs in their own way, to relate and to dedicate their own feelings and their own stories to the songs. For me, daylight will forever be about what I felt when I woke up in the middle of the night and snuggled  up to my now husband after years of heartbreak about the „Red“-guy. 

What I want to say is: Claim lover as your wedding song, tie knots and change rings to invisible strings, party hard to paper rings and don’t stop to buy this dress so he can take it off. Enjoy every second of it, make your own memories and cherish the ones you already made - the songs she left us are a real fuckin legacy and there’s nothing wrong with honoring that legacy by letting the feelings she pictured live on in your own lives.

That came out way more dramatic than it should, but you know what i mean.

Edit: Thank you so much for commenting on this post. I got a lot of nice messages by people that agree with my post and even some messages of people that told me they needed to hear this and it helped them a lot. Unfortunately, also a good amount of rude ones. 

Overall, the sheer amount of interaction on this post absolutely overwhelmed me, as I tried to answer to as much as possible, because I really appreciate everyone taking the time to think of and write a comment.

TaylorSwift,"Goodbye misogyny, hello Taylor","I’m a 28 year old woman who only became a fan very recently. Like I saw her performing the Eras tour on tiktok live and thought “wow this is what I’ve been missing”

Growing up I had friends who listened to Taylor and adored her. But not me, I was too “edgy” to listen to that “garbage”. 

I jumped on every single hate-train against Taylor. I was an avid Taylor hater. And I never had a real reason. 

After seeing some of the Eras tour online I started actually listening to her music and absorbing it all in. I watched the music videos, interviews, live performances etc. 

And I started thinking about why I was so anti-Taylor. The only reason I could come up with is my own internalized misogyny.

The Man was right! If Taylor were a man, things would have been so different for her. And I’m now feeling so bad about all the backlash and hate and judgement she’s received. But I’m happy to see these stadiums full of adoring fans screaming and crying because they can’t even contain themselves. 

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk. And if you’re still unable to appreciate all the talent and skill Taylor has; and how much hard work and love she has put into her music, maybe it’s time to look inside and see if you also have some misogyny lurking.",0.94,2455,0,2455,kikiorangutan,2023-04-29 05:09:10,132hpa4,t3_132hpa4

TaylorSwift,Does anyone else think the fandom is getting a little out of hand?,"Specifically on tiktok recently I’ve seen a lot of things from swifties that just feel like crossing personal boundaries in my opinion but I want to know what other people think. 

For example I saw someone put a picture of her house on their eras outfit, someone buy the prom dress that her childhood best friend wore to prom (this one really weirded me out), buying her phone case because it was in a tiktok for 1 second, and recreating outfits from when she was little (like 8-12). 

Also bombarding her friends, exes, and Joes comment section with lyrics and references is so annoying, like they are their own people. For example Laura dern posted a photo with a purple backdrop and the whole comment section was about speak now tv. The same goes for anything Karly Kloss puts on tiktok. She posted about her coding program for young girls and all of the comments where about Taylor even though that’s unrelated. 

Does anyone else think the fandom needs a reality check or just me?",0.96,2457,0,2457,WayHaunting4815,2023-04-08 06:39:21,12fbneg,t3_12fbneg

TaylorSwift,It's time to talk about Sunday in Nashville,"My wife and I, like many others, parked downtown and walked over the bridge to the show. The rain was just starting to drizzle, but it seemed like everything would be okay. 

We took our seats around 4:30, but the rain eventually picked up so we retreated into the concourse, where we would camp for the next 4 hours. 

By 9:00 we were honestly hoping the show would have been canceled or postponed. We were cold, exhausted, and frustrated. I knew we wouldn't be able to bring the energy that Taylor warranted. 

Sure enough, we brought it hard for Lover and Red, byt by the time she got to Folklore and Evermore, we couldn't stand up for more than a minute or two without needing to rest. It's a shame because those were the two albums we were most excited for. 

I will say that despite the rain and delays, Taylor did not hold back. She came with all the energy of every other show. We just couldn't match it. I looked around and noticed many others in section C sitting as well. Some of them started leaving when Midnights started. 

Ultimately I feel like I have to lie to myself and others and say that it was such a great experience because it's Taylor Swift, but in reality it was miserable. I doubt a show like that can be rescheduled, so I get that it had to go on. I just feel like so many people are talking about how amazing it was when that wasn't what we saw. 

I also feel really bad for the people who spent thousands on resell tickets to get that show.",0.89,2449,0,2449,Scheme84,2023-05-14 14:09:58,13hakcc,t3_13hakcc

TaylorSwift,Reading this post on Twitter made me realize why I am so bothered about people overly assuming the happenings in Taylor’s life,"Something common we hear these days in TikTok and Twitter is “The breakup was being hinted throughout Midnights”.

Like as if all the songs were just written within a span of few months? Do people not know that albums don’t just happen in a snap? That producing music isn’t easy?

It genuinely baffles me how people think Taylor (and other artists actually) release albums in the moment of feeling. It further proves how people treat her life as a spectacle to enjoy—like it’s public commodity. Taylor may give us hints about her life from time to time but I think it’s plain disservice to her capabilities as a songwriter and complete disrespect for her first, truly longtime relationship for Midnights to be reduced as an “easter egg” to her breakup that literally took place 2 years after Midnights was beginning to be written.

How hard is it to explain that even if Taylor is a “mastermind” and tactical in the celebrity game, she is also human? That she’s also possibly grieving right now? That the feelings she feels right now and share through songs do not define the entirety of her relationship with Joe Alwyn?",0.96,2387,0,2387,TheRoyalFandomMess,2023-04-26 03:29:06,12z2g7a,t3_12z2g7a

TaylorSwift,Midnights Era Messiness Analysis,"So, let me start off by saying: I thought Midnights was a breakup album the very first time I heard it. It’s painfully obvious. There were too few songs that could’ve been tied to her other eras, too many references to Joe. Honestly, I’ve been convinced they weren’t endgame since folklore+evermore. 

Because of this, her recent messiness makes a lot of sense to me. Here’s why. 

Prior to f+e, Red was by far her most mature album, both lyrically and tonally. You can tell how much that relationship had wrecked her, but she’d had the time and space from it afterward to make an incredible album. 

Cue a lot of surprise (for me, anyway) when her next album was 1989. Lots of songs about how she’s supposedly crazy, or being snarky about something…but it really didn’t have any teeth to it when it came to really making a statement about who she was. It seemed very much like a girl trying to bounce back from a relationship that was all-consuming, but she was struggling to figure out what was left. The era was consequently messy AF, with the girl gang drama and “I’d like to be excluded from this narrative” Taylor. 

That album was still one of her biggest, though. Longtime naysayers of hers I knew were spinning 1989 and calling it one of the best of the year. I think this really fueled her messiness, because she basically insulated herself from any criticism (deserved or not) with her stage/famous persona.

Of course, Kimye, Calvin/Tom, and all the other drama then gave us Reputation. She’s already seriously with Joe at this point, and we see that reflected in how much more grounded the music becomes. Yes, she’s still singing about being misunderstood and getting back at people who wronged her…but she’s doing so in a way that feels like it’s coming from a much more secure place.

Then Lover. An underappreciated album, IMO. Peak happiness with Joe, but we start to see little signs of her insecurities and fears. 

Cue the pandemic, and we get folklore+evermore. These are deep and raw and everything we wanted from music at the time. She claims there are lots of other stories in here for once, and in some cases that’s true, but in a lot of ways, it’s not. There are clues all over about the struggles she’s having with Joe, and working with Aaron Dessner brings out that pain in the best, most cathartic way. They’re clearly going around and around in their relationship, and she’s begging him — BEGGING him — to just please give her what she needs. 

I think lockdown forced her to stop for the first time in several years and realize what her life could look like in a real, serious relationship. Not what she thought it should be like, but what it could actually be. And I think that’s where she really built up the pain with Joe. She’d gotten her closest experience yet with safety and security in love, but he wasn’t in the same place. 

So, folklore and evermore are the grownup Red. Which means…yep. Midnights is 1989, 2.0.

It’s got a lot of the same snark as 1989 and still lacks the teeth of Reputation, but there’s the same sense of not knowing herself anymore — an almost existential crisis as you see her internal battle, in my opinion, between desperately needing and wanting the love and validation from her fans, and really wishing she could have the more stable, contained life she had with Joe when she hid from the media and during lockdown. She’s telling us to stop putting her on a pedestal, but then still maximizes her stage presence and her million album variants like someone who doesn’t know how to not be on top. And she’s using the intense fandom to distract her from any potential consequences. I think she’s having an identity crisis, and that’s why she’s clinging to a guy she’s known forever. In a weird way, it’s grounding for her because it’s a touch point back to her pre-Joe self. 

Anyway, my reasoning for all of this is because I ended a marriage for a lot of the same reasons that you hear in folklore, evermore, and YLM. It’s not that they’re a bad person. It’s not that you’re being unreasonable. But sometimes what you need isn’t something the other person is capable of giving you. And I can tell you how UNBELIEVABLY hard it is to accept that and make the decision to leave. It tears you down to your very core and it’s excruciating having to put yourself back together. And yes, sometimes you take a very circuitous (and stupid) route to get there. So I think she’s in a very 1989-like headspace, she’ll eventually get brought back down to earth, and real Taylor will re-emerge. 

TL,DR; she’s not losing it, she’s heartbroken and doesn’t have the time or ability to process it right now.",0.9,2376,0,2376,Situation_Upstairs,2023-05-28 15:08:08,13u02mv,t3_13u02mv

TaylorSwift,Celebrities shouldn’t have to speak out - unless they’ve said they would.,"This is written in response to the other recent post which used the Manchester Attack and Las Vegas Shooting as justification as to why Taylor is not speaking up, as well as the recent crowds at Electric Lady Studios.

First, I absolutely agree that celebrities should not be expected to be activists, except for one caveat: when celebrities have used marginalised communities for commercial benefit and publicly said they will be an ally. 

For example, Taylor has never take a public stance on immigration, housing, medical expenses/Medicaid, social security, etc. Therefore, I don’t expect anything from her in respect to those issues. LGBTQ+ and women’s rights though? Different story. 

Taylor made a decision to market Lover the way she did. She made a decision to release the singles she did (YNTCD). She made a decision to agree to film Miss Americana, with that also being framed as her political awakening. She made a decision to do interviews with respected publications like Variety on no longer staying silent in respect of those communities. She made the decision to be featured as a ‘silence breaker’ and participate in interviews about sexual assault. She didn’t have to do any of that. 

Also, she planned the Lover tour, which we can assume would have continued the theme for that era. This was years after the Manchester attack (which wasn’t even an attack on a celebrity for being pro LGBTQ+, btw). So she knew about it, and still planned to do a tour that continued Lover’s theme. As for the LV attack, that was on a country music festival with artists that lean republican. I mean Jason Aldean didn’t even speak out on gun control after it, and to do this day, no one knows the motive. Using those two attacks as justification for why Taylor shouldn’t say or do anything is fallacious reasoning. It’s linking two things that have nothing to do with each other and saying one is causative of another, and that’s just not the case. 

And her activism wasn’t during the Obama administration, when gay marriage was passed. This was during the Trump administration. Things are bad now, but they weren’t sunshine and roses under Trump either. The Alt-Right basically had presidential approval to target these communities. What we are seeing now is just a continuation of Trump’s presidency due to his Supreme Court pick, with states passing laws that are less likely to be shot down by that Supreme Court. 

Whilst there has been a minor increase in mass shootings this year in the US, as far as I’m aware, no celebrity has been targeted. And there are plenty with significantly less resources (security, private jets) than Taylor who are saying something, who are still here today and who’s fans haven’t been targeted. 

Her choice to record at Electric Lady is clearly a deliberate decision as well. She wants the crowds and attention, because there are many other places she could record (including her own private home studios) and she filmed the entirety of midnights only being spotted once (and was never spotted for folklore or evermore). She wants to be seen. Not sure why she does but it’s a choice she’s making.

My point is, Taylor made being an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community her personality during Lover. She made hundreds of thousands, maybe millions off that community. Maybe it was just her ‘activist’ era, and she never intended to continue doing that. But people are not wrong for expecting she continue to do what she did during Lover, and what she said she’d continue to do. After all, she TOLD us she was done being silent. 

I think people are trying to justify why Taylor is silent, because it does suck. I think people want to believe Taylor is genuine. But it’s more likely than not that her activism during Lover was a strategic decision to wipe the narrative that she was a Trump supporter, not because she genuinely cares about the issues these communities are facing. 

I’ll finish with this. If safety is a reason to not speak out, then none of us ever should. I’ve seen videos of women testifying at state senates about their abortions they’ve had out of state due to their home state’s abortion laws. Their names are public, and they can be tracked down much more easier than Taylor can. But they still do it, because it’s the right thing to do. If someone with Taylor’s resources, someone who went years not being spotted by the general public, can’t speak out, what hope is there for the rest of us.",0.78,2375,0,2375,corneliastnyc,2023-05-23 23:16:20,13q12hz,t3_13q12hz
TaylorSwift,Dear Reader is more important now than ever,"Taylor has been telling us for a long time now that she's a flawed, complicated, messy person. she's made that clear through her lyrics as far back as her debut album... Picture to Burn are the words of an unhinged person. The Way I Loved You has been the essence of Taylor since forever. Better Than Revenge... I don't even need to explain. the threads of these songs are throughout her entire discography up until Midnights.

she's also been telling us through her actions for just as long. this is the girl who grew up incredibly privileged with a lifestyle and opportunities most of us can't even imagine. Who had no problem calling out her ex boyfriends on television, led the brutal takedown of another woman artist for basically the most petty reasons ever then tried to walk it back and act like she didn't, refused to take a stand for anything for almost all of her career unless it was something that was directly negatively affecting her, and who is okay with surrounding herself with and working with super problematic people.

all of this is to say no one should be aghast right now about what's going on or let down by Taylor. Dear Reader explicitly told us ""you should find another guiding light"". Taylor is kind, talented, ambitious, and charismatic. but she isn't the perfect role model that so many swifties seem to think she is. she isn't your parent, your friend, or someone you should look to for guidance. she's a celebrity and their only jobs are to entertain us. enjoy her music and other content, enjoy the mess, but don't get attached to this idealized version of someone that you've made up in your head.

ETA: please read this properly, guys. most of you get it but so many people are taking from this that Taylor shouldnt be fairly criticized/called out for things like publicly starting a relationship with a racist person which is NOT what this says. it's basically the opposite. she SHOULD be called out. what SHOULDNT happen is the shocked response ""how did this happen!?!?"" and acting like taylor did this to personally hurt you. she has always done fucked up stuff like this so it's not surprising and if your feelings are hurt you need to reflect on why, because she's never been your morality role model. you just might not have been paying enough attention.",0.94,2378,0,2378,[deleted],2023-05-09 19:47:14,13d0lq1,t3_13d0lq1

TaylorSwift,Clarifying some Joe revisionist history,"I've seen a lot of incorrect stuff cited about Joe in the wake of the breakup so I thought I'd clear up some things.

I'm using this timeline for sources, so click on the relevant year for each debunk (so rep tour - look at 2018 etc). I highly recommend reading through it for a much clearer/realistic idea of how things panned out. Fan speculation relies so much on what's publicly and loudly visible, and often timeframes are just completely wrong.

*""He only attended one Reputation Tour show"":* **FALSE.** He attended at least five publicly and we don't know how many he may have been backstage for. 

*""He never protected Taylor from the paparazzi"":* **FALSE.** Here is [a video](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bb454161f17a1f83444b499fff1be4e7/7e2fd5cc0ae281d1-b4/s1280x1920/7b677d219d52c3fea2772d0a059841d9af5ed757.gifv) clearly showing him using his own body as a barrier for her against the paps. 

*""He never attended any special events with her"":* **FALSE.** They very publicly attended the 2020 Golden Globes together and were shown on camera several times. They also attended the NME Awards together not long after. Way back in 2017, he was standing in the audience with her at Jingle Ball watching other performances. And again, just because we didn't see them together at an event, doesn't mean they didn't attend together. Taylor has also never walked a red carpet with any partner. 

*""He never supported her""*: **FALSE.** Toward the end perhaps, but throughout, there were many instances of him showing her support. When asked about breaking her political silence in 2018, he said ""It's great, I think it's important"" before being rushed away by a publicist. She also cited him as one of the people who helped her become more openly political: *""I found myself talking about government and the presidency and policy with my boyfriend, who supported me in speaking out.""*

*""They never went out in public together"":* **FALSE.** Again, just look through any year of the timeline links post May 2017, and there are tons of paparazzi pics of them out and about. Even when they weren't publicly known to be dating yet, she was still seeing his movies and they were navigating a social life. 2019 was almost as public as Travis just without Joe talking to press or on a podcast. And as Taylor just clarified, she managed to date Travis out of sight for almost two months before she publicly attended a football game for the first time.

*""Tolerate It is about Joe"":* **Leaning toward false.** She may have been experiencing aspects of what the song addresses, but the song was written in early 2020 and, as I've shown, they seemed to be in a good space during that time. There's also the ""so much older"" lyric and the lose weight lyric which is why I think the song pertains more to Calvin (as he was older and her weight was at its worst when they were dating).

*""Bejeweled is about Joe"":* **Unlikely.** Again, Bejeweled brings up many similar themes to Tolerate It and the album is (largely) about reflecting on past relationships/sleepless nights. I think it's more of an awful coincidence that it appears to have suited Joe so well in the end too.

*""Midnights is a break up album/She and Joe were pretending to still be together"":* **Not as simple as that.** Midnights was confirmed to have been largely written and recorded in November 2021. Now we know Taylor also wrote and recorded You're Losing Me in December 2021 (she also released Renegade in July 2021). Does that suggest major issues? Of course. But they also did not break up for another 1.5 years. They were caught kissing by the paparazzi 6 months after she recorded You're Losing Me, and he was at her Grammys afterparty in February 2023. Ryan Reynolds wrote a positive piece about him for Time magazine in September 2022. Joe liked Taylor's Eras rehearsal post on IG just weeks before they ended it. They either had or were close to buying an 8 million dollar house. He was still very much part of her life until March 2023. None of the cracks in their relationship are public, aside from the insight she allows in her lyrics.

My only guess is that his not showing to Eras was too big to overcome. After 6 months rigorous training, after relocating throughout 2021 to various places for him while he filmed, after including him in her creative process during quarantine, and whatever else, perhaps it was too much to have him just not even show up, or perhaps not even plan to show up anytime soon once the tour began. I can only speculate but to say they were always bad or he was always absent or they never had anything good is still plain wrong.",0.86,2242,0,2242,Glitteryskiess,2023-12-08 07:30:01,18dgor5,t3_18dgor5

TaylorSwift,I wish we were done with the re-recordings,"I think is an unpopular opinion but I really wish all the re-recording were out already, don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful for all the vault songs and I really love them, but it kinda brings a shadow or an anxiety or something that I don’t enjoy. I have seen people say “don’t wish for 1989 TV, let Speak Now have its moment”, but that’s the thing, I lived the Speak Now era when it happened, and even though is fun to relive it, the constant feeling of it’s not done yet, brings a shadow to anything she releases, at least for me, I couldn’t really enjoy Midnights because I was waiting for Speak Now TV, I don’t think I will fully enjoy Speak Now TV, because I will be waiting for 1989 TV and so on, but if all the re-recordings were out there, I will just be thankful for anything she releases because I will not be expecting it, and the Easter Eggs won’t be like is that for 1989, or Reputation or Debut? It will be for something new, and it will just be awesome because it will be new. Like I get why she doesn’t release them all at the same time, I get it.

TaylorSwift,Taylor Swift needs Aaron Dessner to keep her lyrics sounding fluid and mature,"Folklore and Evermore stand out because Taylor entrusted much of the songwriting with Aaron Dessner. 

Taylor Swift has a habit of writing lyrics that don’t work on the page, and only work in the song. By that I mean she often sings few-syllable words as many-syllable words. 

This can work in songs for various reasons, for instance, most people enjoy the song Cruel Summer in which Taylor sings the words “cru-oo-oo-ool suh-um-mer.” But in the wrong context, this lyrical style can often feel tiresome and not very tasteful. 

Aaron Dessner helps Taylor use extra words to make the lyrics “click” into a structure more effectively as opposed to elongating a single word.


I began to notice a decline in certain Taylor Swift song lyrical structures when Midnights come out. The production is great, but there are some stinker lyrics. And I think it’s just a matter of going through a few more drafts before release.",0.81,2133,0,2133,ChrisNolan2020,2023-05-26 17:51:59,13sgukd,t3_13sgukd

TaylorSwift,Update: Is Midnights Taylor's worst era?,"Four months ago I made a post asking if y'all think Midnights is Taylor's worst era thus far and listed things that made me feel uneasy about it at the time. Some said yes, some said it's not an era, some told me I'm a horrible person for making critiques... Ya know, the usual 🤪 If you're gonna say I'm not a fan (have been for 17 years) or that I'm just hating, please go find the post nobody cared about where I talked about all the stuff I liked about Midnights/this era lol!

With all the shenanigans as of late, I'm wondering how y'all are feeling now, so I thought I'd go back and see if I still feel the same or differently about my previous points!


1) The Ticketmaster disaster. That was rough! I did end up miraculously getting tickets after Taylor spoke out about it. I saw her perform in Vegas and it was epic. I've got mixed feelings... Hate Ticketmaster. Loved the concert experience.


2) The unnecessary remixes. This still annoys me. I do like the Illenium version of Anti-Hero though. I don't care about the others and just ignore them.


3) The art style of the photoshoots that made Midnights seem like it would have 70s vibes. Idk, now with people thinking it's because of The 1975.... I don't even wanna think about it 🥲 Moving on!


4) The lack of Lana on Snow On the Beach. Fixed! Curious to see what it will sound like. 


5/6) Capitalist Taylor. We now have a very helpful chart that was posted today of which songs you get on each version of the album. The fact that we need this is ridiculous. I was that girly who bought all 4 versions of Lover, but now I'll stick to streaming instead of wasting my money like that. I'm over it.


7) I felt spoiled by track 5s until I heard YOYOK. Didn't love it. Still don't. I did smile when I graduated last weekend and saw the lyrics on caps though. That was cool.


8) Some of the production, such as what people have called the ""James Charles voice"". I still think I'd prefer to have more of Taylor's normal voice in Midnight Rain but other than that I like the production of Midnights. Especially Maroon. That song slaps.


9) Some of the lyrics just make me cringe. ""Your eyes are flying saucers from another planet,"" for example. That's still true... Some songs I have to be in the mood for and not mind the cheese 🧀


And now I'll add #10: Matty. I really want to hear ""You're Losing Me"" and whatever music she puts out next, but I'm absolutely dreading the possibility of her writing gushy stuff about Matty or throwing Joe under the bus unless he did something pretty bad 😭🤦‍♀️ I won't bother to make this post even longer (this point could be a whole post, I have FEELINGS about it) since we've got the BuzzFeed article and plenty of good posts about the latest drama and why it's disgusting, but I'll just say it has absolutely solidified my opinion that this is her messiest era, and I've been a fan since her first single, so... That's a big pile of eras for Midnights to claw her way to the top as the #1 messy/problematic/controversial era.

How do you feel about the Midnights era now? Love it? Hate it? Want it to be over? Can't get enough? We all have our subjective opinions and I think it's interesting to get different takes, especially now that the album has been out for a while. Has your opinion changed? Improved? Devolved?

Edit: Holy Swift that's a lot of comments. I'm sorry if we were in the middle of a conversation and I disappeared! All my notifications are getting buried. But I appreciate the Swifties who contribute to these discussions! Thanks all ♥️",0.77,2020,0,2020,itsthenugget,2023-05-25 03:55:58,13r4pn4,t3_13r4pn4

To this day it's my favorite aesthetic she's ever done.  I was so disappointed that the album didn't actually sound like that at all though (other than Glitch, imo).  But I Can See You really gives me this energy, and I love it so much for that.  I would die for an entire album of these kind of songs.

TaylorSwift,Thank You Swifties ❤️,"I figured this was the right place to post this, but my wife is a HUGE Taylor fan. She didn’t get concert tickets even though we tried and tried. So she was beyond excited about the concert movie. She has been planning and making friendship bracelets with song titles on them in hopes to trade with someone who went to see the movie.

Mind you - we live in the middle of nowhere in Kentucky. Me being the husband I am, I was beyond worried that she wouldn’t have anyone to trade them with and she would be upset. 

We get to the theater today - it’s empty. Finally during the previews a group of 3 walks in. They were as equally as excited to see my wife as she was to see them. They did not know each other. However, one of them brought bracelets to trade as well (I guess this is a thing? My wife says so anyway). They traded bracelets and sung together the whole movie.

I was so worried for my wife because I knew how excited she was and I didn’t want her to be sad and disappointed. So what I’m saying is, I’ve never seen a group of fans be as dedicated and loving as Swifties. Thank you guys. Honestly, from the bottom of my heart. 

Swifties made my wife’s whole week. I haven’t seen her this happy in a while. ❤️",0.96,1970,0,1970,syntheticstructure,2023-10-19 23:47:47,17bunhk,t3_17bunhk

TaylorSwift,The true story of Taylor Swift and Bankrupt Slut," This poster was authorized by Taylor's team back in 2012. I helped it become reality, inadvertently. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ The Lucky One -- Taylor Swift and Bankrupt Slut, Los Angeles, California, November 2012, from the \\""RED\\"" album campaign ](https://preview.redd.it/w3ibvagxvcpb1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c22e185b4d521bf70c8cca68f93186af9df082)

&amp;#x200B;

 

This is all one hundred percent a true story.

I've been trying to find the pieces of this story for the past month now, because it began almost 11 years ago and I don't have access to the same computer. Some of the people involved in the story may have passed away or otherwise slipped out of the internet, but the fact remains it did happen and was real, and I was a part of it.

A month ago or so, I made a comment here on Reddit that I remembered Taylor's managers hired a band, because of an article I wrote, and a photograph I took in Los Angeles, back in 2012.

I had **TOTALLY, completely** forgotten about this for over a decade. Someone posting something else about her on here stirred my memories of it.

Ever since that day, I've gone back into all my harddrives, my closets, and my SD card photo albums to find the evidence to prove to you that this did happen and I wasn't crazy.

When I saw the 1989 vault puzzle spell out the letters ""***S L U T""*** today, I knew, that ready or not, even if I didn't have every scrap of evidence, interview, or HD photo I wanted for it, I needed to tell this story.

**\*\~\~\~ How something I did as a crazy fan led to Taylor's people hiring Bankrupt Slut \~\~\~\***

For context, I'm a very hardcore Gaga stan. I was never into Taylor. Which is why I forgot all about this story, since at the time, the whole country princess Taylor wasn't up my elder millennial alley, sadly. (yes I regret this now, as now I am a full blown hardcore Swiftie)

I'd been writing about Gaga and collecting her memorabilia in the fandom and fansites since 2010. One of my passions is collecting rare posters of hers. It all started for me with an incredibly weird poster I saw in Los Angeles back in 2012, calling her a Bankrupt Slut. It was very odd, and kinda fit with Gaga's risque image at the time.

Gaga was very much like a modern day feminist trailblazer in the same vein as Madonna, so it wasn't unheard of to associate her with that word, ""slut"". Taylor Swift, on the other hand, well..... you don't picture that word when you envision Miss Americana herself, now do you! (until TODAY, Taylor Nation, you teases, you!)

I had no idea what Bankrupt Slut was, but I loved the fact they put Gaga on a poster. It looked edgy and cool!

Googling them led me to discover their art. Bankrupt Slut is a four person rock and metal band that also is huge in the street art world (think Banksy, but with IMPACT font and half naked pop starlets).

They don't shy from using four letter words, singing about female empowerment, or describing the joys of sex in their songs. The lead singer of the band was an artist and also cofounded and wrote one of the biggest street art collective blogs of the 2010s, ""Melrose and Fairfax""  (I can't link it here because of subreddit rules but google it please)  They even had their art showcased at MOCA in LA and in New York City's modern street art galleries.

Reddit limitations prevent me from linking their socials here, but if you go to Youtube and search for ""Bankrupt Slut - Graffiti Saved My Life"" you can see a cool music video and get a taste for the band's music.

You can see the picture of the Gaga poster here:

&amp;#x200B;

[Lady Gaga Bankrupt slut poster, circa 2012](https://preview.redd.it/eojjnffmwcpb1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74d6ca96ced4d12435dc3a555f031dc6c33b148a)

&amp;#x200B;

 

One day, I was stuck in LA by myself for 6 hours. One of my family members was having an operation and there were hours with nothing to do but wait. Bored and restless, I ended up wandering the streets for a while by the hospital with my point and shoot camera. I found one of the Bankrupt Slut Gaga posters, pasted to an electrical box! Delighted with my discovery, I snapped a ton of pics. Of course I wanted to take it home! Rushing to the drugstore, I blew all my pocket money on a boxcutter at the CVS on La Cienega, came back to the poster, and sliced Gaga right off that box.

My family thought I was insane when I told them. To tell the truth, I had no plan for actually re-entering the hospital with a huge torn off poster of a pop star and a four letter word on it... I sheepishly begged a trash bag off a janitor or someone, so I could hide the ""sluttiness"" and imagry from the hospital patrons as I brought my trophy up through the elevators.

I ended up so excited that night, that I wrote a detailed, very long article. I have linked it here and hope the subreddit rules allow this link: 

[http://gagaverse.com/archives/GagaDaily2\_2013\_02\_20/Lady\_Gaga/News\_Discussion/035604\_Bankrupt\_Slut\_\_Gaga\_Appears\_on\_Street\_Art\_Posters\_In\_Los\_Angeles/page0001.html](http://gagaverse.com/archives/GagaDaily2_2013_02_20/Lady_Gaga/News_Discussion/035604_Bankrupt_Slut__Gaga_Appears_on_Street_Art_Posters_In_Los_Angeles/page0001.html)

This article, would turn out to be really important, but I didn't know that yet.

 This was the photo I took of the Gaga poster, before I sliced it off the wall. 

&amp;#x200B;

[my photo of the Gaga BS poster nearby the hospital](https://preview.redd.it/57pyn41excpb1.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=320de7017b334b5f290f749d8fa9e4d90dfb8ece)

 

I happily posted it to the Gaga fanpage, and went to sleep, still happy I rescued the poster and preserved it from the elements. I was smiling all day. My family member had come through their operation, and I bored them silly with my story of adventure, and boxcutters, and Bankrupt Slut, and Lady Gaga.

My article, meanwhile, caught some attention.

The band themselves, Bankrupt Slut, joined the Gaga fanpage to thank me for the story I had written. They offered to send me a carepackage with some ""slutty"" merch. And they did! They sent me their Bankrupt Slut album, 2 teeshirts I can't be seen in public with (not in the conservative city I live in!) and some stickers. I ended up corresponding with the band pretty frequently, and we talked about music and our hobbies, and the troubles they were having with their music on SoundCloud.

One day, a couple weeks after the article was written, the lead singer, Johnny, wrote me a VERY excited email. He had gotten contacted by Taylor Swifts' team. They saw the article, and saw the photo I took of Gaga as a Bankrupt Slut. They liked it so much, they emailed Johnny.

This is a screenshot of that email. Private details have been redacted because I know how intense Swifties get :D

&amp;#x200B;

[BS gets email from TS team](https://preview.redd.it/1rimzxgkxcpb1.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34c9485f5b8feb4c324f849135dd5ad0739f559a)

 

I can't believe Taylor's team would bother reading a Gaga fansite, and even find my article to begin with! I was so excited.

Of course, I was super happy for them! What a great story, that Taylor had seen the poster, and loved it! Soon he wrote me again, saying that they specifically wanted to use the poster from my photograph:

&amp;#x200B;

[lol maybe BS is too much for Taylor](https://preview.redd.it/1bjux4tpxcpb1.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c2971df247a66bd55e292b2cc7cc337da9412ff)

&amp;#x200B;

 And finally, a day or two later, Johnny wrote me back to say they got hired. Taylor's team approved the promo art for her ""Red"" album, and allowed the band to put the words ""BANKRUPT SLUT"", as they had with Gaga's. 

&amp;#x200B;

[BS got the gig with Taylor](https://preview.redd.it/1dtswu9xxcpb1.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26fb20830c51971cc80ac898eb46e679b7b57e55)

 At this point, the band was so grateful, they sent me a demo of a song they wrote about the entire experience, even mentioning me. It was really an honor. And I get the feeling they were paid pretty well for the whole thing because they kept writing me how happy they were to get the gig and how many opportunities were opening up for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not me writing about Taylor and Red in the song description and forgetting about it completely for 10 years LMAO . I really did forget. But I'm so glad I remembered it now.

Johnny and Bankrupt Slut's street team stuck the Taylor poster on Los Angeles streets for about 6 months. You can see the article on it here, with the Taylor poster in full view:

Pretty long run, for a poster made of paper and wheat paste. Not too many photos exist in the wild of this poster, but you can see it on Twitter, on Flickr, and on Bankrupt Slut's Melrose and Fairfax blog, or by searching the hashtag BankruptSlut.

I've tried reaching out to the band again, and contacted some of their friends, but I think the band has disbanded as of at least 2021, when their business license on Bankrupt Slut lapsed. I do have a contact out to one of the band members, and I will be interviewing them more about this experience and to potentially purchase the prints if they are still available in any form. Being that this was over 10 years ago, and wheatpaste posters are not designed to last in the wild, the only source of an original Bankrupt Slut piece will be directly from the band, unless you stole one off the wall, like I did, all those years ago. 

So you can see this entire experience was real:

&amp;#x200B;

[I cannot wear this shirt in polite company but it does slay](https://preview.redd.it/ypreqv5xzcpb1.jpg?width=2736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b336f471c21f85844e017466864b0357c339a634)

[My poster from 2012, that started this whole thing.](https://preview.redd.it/w7856x5xzcpb1.jpg?width=2736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eab6571f96286f85bf14e7fa1f37dc0eee4a8eab)

 

I sorely, deeply, regret never asking them for a Taylor poster, especially considering how it came to exist. I did ask many times for an unripped Gaga one, but they weren't ever able to send me one for whatever reason. Seeing as they did sell their prints at one time, I'm trying to reach out to them again to buy from their website and maybe give them some more promo. They still have their songs available for sale on Itunes, Amazon and Bandcamp, so maybe they are still around and will see how beloved their art is again.

All that being said, thank you for reading this long post. Today's Vault Puzzle and the very suspicious S, U, L and T had me thinking..... well, maybe she's gonna acknowledge that in some way. But if not, hopefully you enjoyed learning about this extremely obscure, wild, out there, crazy TRUE story about Taylor and Bankrupt Slut and street art!!

So, not only do you wanna make the friendship bracelets, and take the moments and taste them, but also, please steal the posters, and frame them, and write stories about your glories so that others might be inspired too. You never know, her team could be watching, like I discovered over a decade ago!

Cheers to all! Have a ""Slutty"" day :D &amp; thanks for reading!

TaylorSwift,The last minute of All Too Well 10 min version,"The last minute of the song is spent with Taylor repeating the variations of “I was there it was rare” and until recently I’ve never known how to interpret this part of the song. Before I just thought it was a nice way to fade out the song and gradually bring it to a close, but recently I’ve gone through an ATW 10 min version similar situation (🥲) and as I listened to the end I now interpret it as the way you kind of have to remind yourself that it was real and you were there and it actually happened as tragic as it was. Almost as a way to console yourself and rationalize that you aren’t crazy and something so personal and intense actually did occur because it feels like the other person doesn’t remember it at all.

Just my interpretation but I’m curious how other people view the ending?",0.98,1962,0,1962,anidala_tingz,2023-11-09 16:40:18,17rfpyg,t3_17rfpyg
TaylorSwift,Swifties are the nicest people I've ever met.,"Last night I went to see Taylor last minute in LA with my husband. To say it was a dream come true was an understatement! As soon as I got there, I was in line to buy merch and I saw a girl with Taylor's Version earrings on them with hearts, and I told her ""I love your earrings, they're so cute!"" And she said thank you and I thought it was just a nice interaction. Instead she stopped me and reached out to me and handed me a hand made sticker of Taylor in her Lover outfit 😭 and then as we were wandering around trying to find our seats, two girls just stopped us and said ""Hey, I noticed you don't have any bracelets yet, do you want some that we made?"" And I have to be honest, all I've ever wanted was a friendship bracelet made by a swiftie and I seriously was so touched that they just picked us out of a hoard of people. 
And singing and dancing and partying with strangers was the best time of my life.
You guys are the best. 
I had the time of my life with you 🥹

TaylorSwift,The realization of an imminent break up: re-analyzing Midnights after You're Losing Me,"Now that it's loud and clear that they've broken up, and after You're Losing Me, it's becoming clear for me that their relationship was much more troubling than what she let us know. Midnights as a whole for me now feels like the realization and road to the break up, instead of a celebration and maturing reminiscence of old albums and relationships as I previously thought it was, and I think it'll be good to revisit the album with that in mind. Beware: huge wall of text and overanalyzing ahead!

# Track 1: Lavender Haze and Track 12: Sweet Nothing

In my interpretation, Lavender Haze feels more like Taylor was trying to pretend that they were in their strongest and that she was getting used to the things he wanted (a.k.a not getting married), while they were actually breaking apart silently. ""I just wanna stay in that lavender haze"" now feels more like she was trying to feel that again and stay at that level of loving, and trying to save their love. ""All they keep asking me is if I'm gonna be your bride"" and ""No deal, the 1950s shit they want from me"" was she pretending not to care that she wasn't getting a proposal anytime soon, while in true she actually did want to get married with him (Paper Rings, Lover), but HE didn't, which becomes explicit as a real pain to her in You're Losing Me (""And I wouldn't want to marry me either"").

She also talks about him not paying full attention to her, which I will talk more about in this write up, and is explicit at ""Starin' at the ceilin' with you, oh, you don't ever say too much, and you don't really read into my melancholia"", which is why I think this song deeply connects to Sweet Nothing, another song about their relationship and how complex it was. At she same time, all he ever wanted from her was nothing, which is the sweetest con, because, while she appreciated that, maybe she wanted everything from him. Those aspects, in both of these songs, shows how bittersweet this all was to her.

# Track 2: Maroon and Track 17: High Infidelity

Maroon, which I previously thought to be about Jake Gyllenhal, a more mature reinterpretation of Red (Maroon = a darker shade of Red), and even though it's definitely a callback, actually fits with Joe more, and I think this is about one of their many break ups (""And I wake with your memory over me, that's a real fucking legacy to leave"" in Maroon), and to clarify it Joe was the only guy that Taylor dated that had a roommate IIRC (""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how""), showing that this was a troubling relationship just like she had with Jake, but this time even darker, even more heart wrenching.

The lyrics ""And I chose you the one I was dancin' with in New York"" could be compared to High Infidelity (""I was dancing around in high infidelity""), which seems to be about going out with Joe while dating Calvin (from Gorgeous ""And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us he's in the club doing, I don't know what"" and ""And you should think about the consequence of you touching my hand in the darkened room"", which tells she was with Calvin, a boyfriend she didn't really care about, and got involved with Joe and Tom Hiddleston in the middle of it).

# Tracks 3 - 5: Anti-Hero, Snow on the Beach and You're On Your Own, Kid

I put these together since they don't reveal too much on this whole story, Anti-Hero and YOYOK are mostly about herself and her story, HOWEVER there are a couple of interesting lines in these songs. In Anti-Hero she thinks about losing him (""I wake up screaming from dreaming, one day I'll watch as you're leaving 'cause you got tired of my scheming for the last time""; and some lyrics in YOYOK (""I wait patiently he's gonna notice me, it's okay, we're the best of friends anyway"") could be referring to Joe not paying too much attention to her, something she explicitly wanted him to do as seen in YLM (""Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me "" and ""Do something, babe, say something"").

Snow on the Beach nevertheless seems to be about the beginning of their relationship, ""Flying in a dream, stars by the pocketful, you wanting me tonight feels impossible, but it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around"", which is cohesive with Gorgeous, a song that it's about wanting and thinking about him. This song is also quite interesting since she is remembering the more peaceful times in their relationship, which is a recurring subject in this album.

# Tracks 6, 7 and 19: Midnight Rain, Question...? and Would've Could've Should've

These are songs I don't think are about Joe, but it's interesting to notice how she's reminiscing about old relationships in the album. I interpret this as, while she falls out of love with him, maybe even during a break up, she thought about her exes a lot on midnights like that. In Question...? she seems to be talking about the same person she sang in The 1, an old relationship that left unfinished matters and that she often thinks about (""Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight? When she said it was too much? Do you wish you could still touch her? It's just a question"")

# Track 9: Bejeweled

Now this is a big one. The whole song, which I thought to be about Calvin, I now definitely think it's about Joe, and it makes much more sense. She wasn't out of the top of the world during her relationship with Calvin, it was during 2015 and 2016, which was literally her peak at the time, she was in the 1989 era, and definitely didn't stop shining for that. ""Sapphire tears on my face, sadness became my whole sky"" seems to be about a relationship she deeply cared about, which I don't think the Calvin one was.

This also says about he not paying much attention to her again (""Don't put me in the basement when I want the penthouse of your heart""). But the core of the song is, after getting off the pandemic, and being in a very private relationship and hiding her personal life (which seems to be something that really mattered for Joe) she wanted to shine again. And she wouldn't let him keep that from her. "" You can try to change my mind, but you might have to wait in line. What's a girl gonna do? A diamond's gotta shine"".

# Track 10: Labyrinth

I think this one is definitely a song that explains the core of their relationship: she deeply loved him, was terrified of losing him and they were very on and off. I think this is about all of their break ups (""It only hurts this much right now, was what I was thinking the whole time"", ""I'll be getting over you my whole life""), their come backs together (""I thought the plane was going down, how'd you turn it right around"") and the fear that it might not last forever (""Never trust it if it rises fast, it can't last"").

Unfortunately, it came to it's end when coming back wasn't an option, and after all this roller coaster of a relationship, it finally worn out when she didn't love him enough to try to keep this going (""How long could we be a sad song? Till we were too far gone to bring back to life?"" in You're Losing Me).

# Track 14: The Great War

This song, that seems to be about the same story she told in Afterglow, is about a time in their relationship in which she felt really paranoid that he was cheating on her, and about their biggest fight. ""You drew up some good faith treaties, I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone. You said I have to trust more freely, but diesel is desire, you were playin' with fire"" in The Great War x ""I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue, put you in jail for something you didn't do. I pinned your hands behind your back, thought I had reason to attack, but no"" in Afterglow.

In both songs she holds herself accountable, but there are a couple key differences. In Afterglow she poses herself as the causer of everything and apologizes (""It's all me in my head, I'm the one who burned us down, but it's not what I meant. I'm sorry that I hurt you""), while in The Great War she tries to understand why she reacted like that and caused all that (""Maybe it's the past that's talking, screaming from the crypt, telling me to punish you for things you never did""), a more mature interpretation of those events. There's not much to digress on it. Maybe he did cheat and it was all justified, maybe he didn't and she was just paranoid, but we'll never know. What matters is that at the end of it all, they didn't win the Great War.

# The Sleepless Nights and Track 20: Dear Reader

Now this is one of the songs I don't think it's ABOUT Joe but about how she FELT about him when things turned dark, and at the same time obviously a tell to the fans about who she actually is, and how we shouldn't put her up in a pedestal. I think this song, as much as other Midnights song, has a double meaning (Mastermind also could be both about her relationship to Joe while being about her relationship with us, the fans).

""Dear reader, if it feels like a trap, you're already in one. Dear reader, Get out your map, pick somewhere and just run"" seems to be her realizing the realization might not last, and she should just call it quits, but then she relapses back to him, because she herself doesn't think she's reliable: ""You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking, if you knew where I was walking. To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there"" and ""You should find another guiding light"".

Now I think we could also interpret this as the  reverse point of view from This Is Me Trying. In that song she sang ""Pouring out my heart to a stranger, but I didn't pour the whiskey"", and in Dear Reader she sings about ""My fourth drink in my hand, these desperate prayers of a cursed man spilling out to you for free"" which are very very similar.

Now I want to call us back to the very first announcement of the Midnights album and the text she wrote about it. ""We lie awake in love and in fear, in turmoil and in tears, we stare at walls and drink until they speak back. We twist in our self-made cages and pray that we aren’t — right this minute — about to make some fateful life-altering mistake. This is a collection of music written in the middle of the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams. The floors we pace and the demons we face. For all of us who have tossed and turned and decided to keep the lanterns lit and go searching — hoping that just maybe, when the clock strikes twelve … we’ll meet ourselves.""

Now that's quite dramatic for this little pop album isn't it Taylor? Well no, maybe it isn't. ""We lie awake in love and in fear, in turmoil and in tears"" they were on and off a lot, love and sadness mend a lot during the relationship. ""This is a collection of music written in the middle of the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams"" the music was written in the middle of the nights they were broken up, and the journey through terrors and sweet dreams is the actual relationship, it's Taylor literally defining the relationship and, thus, this album, since I believe Midnights is simply and purely the pure essence of all they went through..

Honestly I never got the concept, but now with all that we know about the relationship this makes so much sense. These were sleepless nights through her life, through her relationship, cementing the core of the album in Dear Reader (the original 3.A.M. closing track): ""So I wander through these nights, I prefer hiding in plain sight"". It tells us how at the end, she really felt like she was lost. She was sleepless and troubled with the relationship, felt lost in life and had to find her way to safety, to find a guiding light. And that was when she realized, he was losing her.

# From The Vault: You're Losing Me

The big and extremely sad conclusion to this whole album and relationship. It follows all of the themes of the album, and cements it as the road to the break up. This is not the break up, this is the final realization that it's over, a song that tells about everything that led her to breaking up with him.

""You say: I don't understand, and I say: I know you don't"" is about how she realizing they are not quite right for each other, his way of loving is different from what she wants, which is a natural conclusion to Lavender Haze and Sweet Nothing.

""We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't. Remember looking at this room, we loved it 'cause of the ligh. Now I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time. Do I throw out everything we built or keep it? I'm getting tired, even for a phoenix, always rising from the ashes, mending all her gashes. You might just have dealt the final blow. Stop, you're losing me. I can't find a pulse, my heart won't start anymore for you"" refers to themes she wrote throughout the album, they broke up and got together many times, but this time they didn't. It was already too far gone, she had no strength in her to put it back together.

""Every morning, I glared at you with storms in my eyes, how can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dying? I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick. My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick. And the air is thick with loss and indecision."" tells about how she tried to tell him how she couldn't handle it anymore, she wanted more attention from him, she wanted to be in the penthouse of his heart, but he didn't understand it. He loved her the way he could, and didn't understand why she felt like that, there's no way they could mend it now.

""And I wouldn't marry me either, a pathological people pleaser, who only wanted you to see her"". It all goes back to Lavender Haze and Sweet Nothing. She wanted more than he could give. She wanted a marriage, he didn't. She wanted him to read through her melancholia, her deep feelings, but he didn't. ""Do something, babe, say something, lose something, babe, risk something, choose something, babe, I got nothing to believe, unless you're choosing me"" remember all of those photos of Taylor waiting for the phone to ring in the Midnights photoshoots? That was her waiting for him to say something, for him to do something, and, at the end, he didn't.

# Conclusion: it hit different

In conclusion: their relationship was a troubling one, they weren't right for each other as it seemed, she wanted more from him and he didn't gave her. Hits Different is the song that talks about the aftermath of the end, and how she felt about it. I'm not going to talk about it more, because it's pretty self explanatory. It was the love time could never mend, and the one that hurt the most.

Midnights talks about the whole relationship, from the beginning, through their good and bad moments, their big fights, the fading out of their love and the how she felt about it, and it shows how much more personal this as an album is as we once thought. The album is as troubling as the relationship, with misguided lyrics (like how she tried to fool herself on the issues), double meanings (paralleling the Joe relationship with past relationships) and, at the end, a happy pop album that is actually the saddest of them all, the carnations we once thought of roses, that was them.

I left a few songs out (Karma, Vigilante Shit, BTTHS, etc.) since they aren't essentially about the relationship, and, while a few are (Glitch and Paris), they're about their good moments together, something I talked about previously. Anyways, thanks everyone who read until here!

Edit: One bit of info that I'd like to add is that this line in Hoax (""You knew the hero died, so what's the movie for?"") seems to have a callback in Hits Different (""This is why they shouldn't kill of the main guy""), explaining how hard it is for Taylor to understand how to ""make it make some sense"" that this relationship that went for so long and really felt like THE ONE ultimately didn't last. Honestly there are so many callbacks from past songs from Folklore and Evermore (""I gave so many signs"" in Exile x ""I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick"" in YLM) that could grant it's own post.

Edit 2: Sleepless Nights and Dear Reader section added.

Edit 3: Guys be sure to read the comments, there are so many great insights people made in here! I'd also like to add that the 3AM tracks now make much more sense. The original 13 tracks end with Mastermind, a happy closing to the album and relationship, while the 3AM edition ends with Dear Reader, the sad realization about everything, symbolizing her change in thinking that they could mend it back together in the OG album to the relationship fading away in the 3AM tracks (that have many songs talking about old relationships) and eventually ending it in the 'Till Dawn/Late Night tracks, paralleling her process of thought (break up &gt; get back together &gt; rebound &gt; rinse and repeat until she realize it's really over), explaining why the album is so full with initially dissonant tracks.",0.95,1939,0,1939,Lipe18090,2023-05-27 04:15:28,13sve7h,t3_13sve7h

TaylorSwift,Taylor working with a vocal coach recently,"Hi everybody!

So for background, I'm a classically trained singer and musician, and I thought this would be interesting to discuss. To me (and I'm sure a lot of us here), Taylor's vocals on The Eras Tour are a huge step up from the Reputation Tour. Her breath control is amazing (see Haunted), her tone is crystal clear (Blank Space, Cruel Summer), and her pitch is 95% perfect. I don't think she's lip-syncing, or at least lip-syncing a lot, so I think this vocal improvement is purely her live vocals. I also noticed that her mouth shape and vowel modulation are very good. 

All of this considered, I have reason to believe she is working with a vocal coach or was before tour. I wonder who the coach is!

Living in America, our gun control issues have been heavy on my mind lately. The last week or so I've watching videos from tour and thinking about what would happen if someone opened fire or brought a bomb or something along those lines. 

I go to see Taylor in Pittsburgh next month and I'm a bit terrified to. I want to see it so badly; I've never seen Taylor live before. But god, what if something did happen at my show or any of the shows? This is tens of thousands of people packed tightly in a stadium. How would I escape? What would I do? 

It's such a horrible intrusive thought I can't seem to shake.",0.87,1891,0,1891,tiredsadandgay,2023-05-08 05:15:42,13bc80x,t3_13bc80x
TaylorSwift,"Just because Matt Healy is at her show, doesn't mean she's dating him and that shouldn't be the immediate conclusion based on a tabloid.","**This isn't an aim at this sub but this is more directed as the overall fandom.** Today was absolutely chaotic the reaction was unbelievably explosive. Taylor announced Speak Now TV, had Phoebe Bridgers perform with her and *all people seem to be talking about is Matt Healy despite the surprise announcement which was Speak Now.* The laughable part is this is all based on a Wattpad written style [""article""](https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/8040595/taylor-swift-matty-healy-confirm-secret-relationship/) from a trash tabloid The Sun. [A tabloid that lacks credibility.](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/guardian-trusted-sun-least-trusted-online-news-brand-pamco-reveals/1492881) Who not long ago [made bold claims that Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn were having a quiet Easter together](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtOlSg-WcAAIDUp?format=jpg&amp;name=small) when [really they actually had broken up](https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-break-up-after-6-years-together/#:~:text=Taylor%20Swift%20and%20Joe%20Alwyn%20have%20broken%20up%20after%20six,first%20to%20report%20the%20news.)

This is a reminder that **just because** The Sun made a claim that Matty Healy was going to be there, which he was. **Doesn't mean the romance Wattpad story they attached with it means it's true.** Matty is extremely close to [Phoebe Bridgers]( https://ukdaily.news/a-deep-dive-into-phoebe-bridgers-and-matty-healys-iconic-friendship-292249.html) who was performing tonight with Taylor for the first time. Matty has also [worked with Taylor on Midnights but the songs he worked on with Taylor didn't make the cut](https://people.com/music/matty-healy-reveals-the-1975-worked-on-taylor-swift-midnights/) removing Bridgers out of the picture, it is logical that he would stop by to see Taylor perform especially when Taylor has [been to his show](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-the-1975-concert-anti-hero-the-city-1235198433/) *they're friends.* Showing up is *normal.* It isn't a coincidence that he also showed up the same day that Phoebe performed for the first time alongside Taylor.

What this also could mean is that someone from Phoebe's end could've caught wind about Matty showing up, leaked it to The Sun and they wrote their Taylor and Matty love story Wattpad fic. Which is the point of tabloids. That is how they make their bread and butter by garnering clicks. Nobody is gonna click or care about a story if it was purely about Matt Healy visiting. *A story about him dating Taylor Swift? Yes. That is click haven.*

Taylor also [mouthed the exact same words Matty said](https://twitter.com/taurusfeelings/status/1654707290803511297). Ironically this is what The Sun claimed they would do. Now I don't know either of them on a personal level but it makes it pretty evident that they probably heard the news about this hilarious tabloid story and decided to take the piss out of everyone especially Matt Healy of all people who is a notorious troll. If there were actual weight and realism to these rumors Taylor mouthing that word for word like some inside joke wouldn't be happening. 

[People also wrote an article](https://people.com/music/matty-healy-spotted-taylor-swift-nashville-show-amid-romance-rumors/) making note that Healy was there but there is **nothing** said by them stating they are dating and acknowledging it as rumors. No where in the article do they state their dating and multiple publications asked for a comment, they've been ignored. Her publicist Tree Paine was even there for this show. If there was actual truth to these rumors that they were dating, US publications, People included would confirm it now. Not saying ""amid rumors...""

Freaking out over the gossip where it holds no weight is a waste of time. Speak Now TV is now happening. She had an incredible Nashville show. Let's stop giving The Sun clicks and or something to talk about when there is absolutely no evidence that they're anything but friends and that stage moment seems like a joke more than anything.

**Disclaimer: If they are dating and I'm proven wrong, there is nothing fans can do. AT least wait for confirmation before thinking the worst and exploding and giving The Sun clicks.**",0.93,1884,0,1884,AccuratePerformer,2023-05-06 09:42:02,139g0w8,t3_139g0w8

TaylorSwift,"A Football Fan Binges Taylor Swift, part 1: I Never Intended To Read A Teenage Girl's Diary","Yesterday's post for context [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/s/2fe1GMHL5r)

**Foreword**

At about 4:30pm eastern on Sunday October 29th, I noticed that there was no game thread for the Chiefs game on r/taylorswift. Did this mean she wouldn't be at the game? I'm an adamant Broncos fan but had been ignoring the broadcast since we were going to get wiped off the turf today by our division rival who had beaten us 16 times in a row, so I hadn't heard the announcers say anything about her absence. 

The Broncos scored on their first possession. At 4:35, as a joke, I messaged my football friends group chat: ""Taylor Swift isn't in Denver, so if we win I will listen to all her albums and write a review for each song."" It's been a bit of a running joke that her presence has been the reason for all the Chiefs wins (the one game she didn't attend ended in a loss), so I thought if she skipped this one and thereby granted us a win, I'd owe her this. The Broncos held the Chiefs to a field goal on their first possession. I was not concerned.

At the beginning of the second quarter, our defense forced a turnover and Russell Wilson delivered a deep strike to Jerry Jeudy, who followed that up with a touchdown reception a couple plays later. I was not concerned.

Halfway through the 4th quarter, our defense prevented Patrick Mahomes from scoring a touchdown on 4th and 2. ""Uh oh."" I texted my group chat. They asked me if I knew how many albums Taylor Swift had. I guessed five. I was wrong. With 5:39 remaining in the 4th quarter, Patrick Mahomes was sacked by his own lineman, ending their must-score drive to stay in the game. Some said the loss was due to Mahomes having the flu, but I knew it was because of her.

Shortly after the game I made a post on r/taylorswift, explaining the monumental task at hand. By the end of the week, I needed to write a review of every Taylor Swift song. To make matters more difficult, I had no subscriptions to any music streaming platforms because I...don't listen to music. At all. Thanks to many fine and helpful Swifties, I've been set up with couple spreadsheets and guidance on how to tackle all 200+ songs written by this popular blond woman. What follows is my attempt to honor my careless words uttered in passing on that fateful Football Sunday.

**Methodology**

Quickly, before diving in, I want to describe how I'm going about this monumental task. First, I will be listening to all of Taylor's songs. That includes the original masters as well as the Taylor's Versions (at first, I thought TV stood for television; it does not). I'll be listening to all EPs and singles, as well as all soundtrack entries and collaborations. I will be listening to the Christmas covers. If a song has a music video, I'll watch it and include it in the track review.

Each track review is more of a reflection on what I was thinking about while listening to the song for the first time. This is an authentic reaction and I didn't want to lose that, because it's not often someone with no real knowledge of Taylor Swift chooses to do something like this. I'll also include more of a high-level review of the album at the end. That final album review will only come after I've read some context on the album from the Taylor Swift Fan Wiki, and will be my attempt at actually representing how I feel once I'm in on a little bit (not a lot!) of the lore.

Finally, while my plan is to post this gargantuan thing as one big block of text on Door Flies Open, I'll post my progress each day on r/taylorswift, because everyone over there was super kind and supportive of the idea and I don't want to make them wait all week to hear how it's going. Special thanks to u/Tsukiakari_12, u/Bake-the-stress-away, u/MeatThatTalks, u/electbody and u/jennymayg13. Alright....let's do this.

**Taylor Swift (2006)**

Q: Alex, you just said that at the end of each section, you'd read the context for the album and write up a 'final thoughts' type thing. Yet here you are doing it at the beginning. Why?

A: Firstly, thanks for asking, you handsome, charming, deeply sensitive and caring person. It's like you were plucked from my dreams. What was the question? OH! Well, as it turns out a lot of my first impressions of this album were pretty negative, and they didn't turn around until I got to the Beautiful Eyes EP. After having listened to Taylor Swift, the Beautiful Eyes EP, and Fearless, I wanted to assure the audience out there in internet-land that I'm not a monster. In fact, I'm really enjoying myself so far and I'm highly optimistic that I'm going to enjoy this whole process and a fair bit of the music.

Q: I see, and how do y--

A: This first album is just the one that I knew I wasn't going to like, you know? I'm about 18 months younger than Taylor and when this music was coming out I was finishing high school. But I was finding myself on the receiving end of a lot of opposite-sex interest that I was discovering that I didn't want - it's not my fault that I'm so damn attractive - so songs about love, longing, and heartbreak were getting in the way of me feeling my true feelings: angst, hatred, and some really stern feelings about authority figures.

Q: I see. But wha--

A: I just don't want people to get the wrong idea! I'm not here to bash Taylor Swift, okay? I read the wiki! Young Taylor seems like a shy but creative little ball of energy and attitude that knew what she wanted, took her thoughts, feelings, and observations about the goings-on of her life and turned them into pop-country fusion songs that resonated with a lot of people, and she did something that's even harder to do - she got listeners to feel what it was like to be a teenage girl. That's an under-represented and difficult to nail perspective.

Q: Just...show us the reviews.


**Tim McGraw [\(Music Video\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkD20ajVxnY)**

33 seconds into the first song and she already said the phrase ""Chevy truck."" This is gonna be a long project. I'm immediately reminded of why I didn't want to listen to Taylor Swift in high school (I graduated in 2008), or associate with anyone who listened to Taylor Swift in high school. Getting started on this has me feeling the tell-tale signs of a panic attack. I think it's setting in what I've signed up to do. I don't listen to music very often at all, and if I did put on music it would not be this. Telling myself it's only a few albums until this twang is gone, according to my new friends on r/taylorswift.

This music video looks like a young girl playing at being a grown up. Can't deny, though, she looks really good holding a guitar. And she does a good job performing her song for the camera, which isn't easy. The guy in this song has his mouth open the whole time and I keep waiting for a bug to fly in.

**Picture to Burn [\(Music Video\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCMqcFAigRg&amp;list=PL12E43D243BEF14F2&amp;index=19)**

33 seconds into the second song and she already said the phrase ""pickup truck."" Did she do that at the same timestamp on purpose? IDK what redneck heartbreak is but it sounds like a drink I'd avoid ordering at a bar in Arkansas. Man, she's really focused on this pickup truck.

Watching the music video, I now understand that part of the reason she's so fixated on the truck is because he never let her drive it. Is this a jealousy thing, Taylor? No judgement. This is like the teenage version of slashing a hole in all four tires of that jeep in another country song I vaguely remember. The banjo player seems pretty cool! As far as direction goes, though, this music video is pretty vanilla. The shots with the sparks in the background and her in shadow are cool though. Oh no, she tossed what I can only assume is his parents' house! Oh, good, it was just a fantasy.

**Teardrops on My Guitar [\(Music Video\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKCek6_dB0M)**

Ooh, sad song. This sounds like a teenage girl wrote it. As an effeminate man since my teenage years, I've always considered myself to have much more in common with girls but I can say with confidence that while I've felt the way she's describing in this song, I would never have wanted to listen to it and marinate in those emotions. Not because I don't like marinating in emotions, either. But because I can't get over the unrequited romantic partner's name is Drew. Sorry for any Drews out there, but if your name is Drew, I'm not interested. I'm also not interested if your name is Rebecca. I'm a romantic asexual - I have standards.

The first three songs all have music videos?! Listen Taylor, I gotta be honest. You can do a lot better than Drew here. This discount Andrew Garfield/Robert Pattinson hybrid is not special. Just buy your current boyfriend a leather necklace and a pullover hoodie, you'll be fine. This music video takes the Tim McGraw approach of vignettes intercut with Taylor hanging out with her guitar. Feels a lot more authentic, though I'm hard pressed to imagine a teenage girl doing her makeup that aggressively to just lay in bed. Yes, this is the stuff I think about when nobody's around.

**A Place in This World**

This song reminds me of the Ally McBeal soundtrack, which I like. Pretty melodramatic but in context it's a lot more mature than the last few tracks. Taylor really wants me to know that she's just a girl. I said that I was a pretty effeminate guy, and I meant it! I spent a number of long road trips listening to women sing about love, and watching Meg Ryan chase after Tom Hanks while laying in a dark hotel room. I get it. This song feels like a journey, and I'm on a journey too.

**Cold as You**

Ah, here's another song about longing. Is this about Drew again? Is it mean to ask that as a joke?...I feel like it's an appropriate time to say that I am, in fact, taking this seriously. Don't confuse my joking tone and dismissive attitude for a lack of interest or buy-in. Instead, you should see it as the first steps toward immersion. Sometimes you have to shiver and throw a fit when you dip your foot into a cold pool the first time. After a bit, it's easier to dunk your head under and enjoy the swim. On a personal note, I wish the accompaniment would take a little more focus sometimes. Part of why I never got into country music was because the music was just there as set dressing for the vocalist, and I want each member of the band to have a unique feel. Who is Taylor playing with, what are they like?

**The Outside**

I'm comparing this song to what I listened to in High School when music was still part of my life. It's upbeat, sad, lonely, and pretty myopic. I wouldn't have listened to it at the time, but the themes aren't too dissimilar from what I was after. What was I listening to in High School, you ask? Well, that's none of your damn business and I'll thank you to stay out of my personal affairs. Unless you want to be my Alternative Girlfriend, I think it's Too Little Too Late for me to be Falling for the First Time.

In the comments of the youtube video I used to listen to this song, someone said that this is the earliest TSwift song to make it onto an album, appearing on her demo discs as far back as five years prior to this album. If that's true, and she wrote this as a pre-teen, that's pretty darn cool. The perspective feels right for that to be true. Not a hugely unique topic to handle, but handled well.

**Tied Together With a Smile**

Another optimistically depressed song! If she was also funny in these songs I'd be having a great time. This is definitely a sad honor's student sort of jam. I don't know if there's room to make jokes about how you feel as a teenager trying to make it as a country star, though. Don't want to get pigeon-holed as a novelty musician. But humor is a way to introduce a little self-awareness to emotional moments, and that's part of what I'm missing here. So far this album has been pretty saccharine and I need a little bitterness or saltiness to cut through the cream.

**Stay Beautiful**

Taylor seems to like to sing songs about people - either her or someone else. Not much about places, things, events, concepts, or anything like that. This song's subject is named Cory, a name that DOES inspire me to adopt a romantic perspective, having been a fanatical viewer of Boy Meets World. Taylor isn't that far from Topanga, right? No? Huge stretch? This song had the first lyric that I really loved. She says ""when he smiles, it's like the radio."" I don't understand that at all but it's profound in a poetic and alien way. I also appreciate that in this song, Taylor's taking a back seat, as opposed to her oft-preferred passenger's seat, and saying she hopes they are together in the future. That's nice.

**Should’ve Said No [\(Music Video\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9bxXO9fj98&amp;list=PL12E43D243BEF14F2&amp;index=18)**

This song is about cheating! This and Picture to Burn both have more aggressive choruses, which I guess is to reflect Angry Taylor. Grr, Angry Taylor sings over electric guitar riffs and tells you what you did wrong.

This music video shows Taylor performing live, and I love it! She's got on a hoodie and blue jeans, and has the hood up with her hair covering her eyes. That's how I would perform, so that I couldn't see everyone looking at me. She sounds like she's working hard, and is clearly not lip syncing which I think is cool as hell. Two guys just pulled off her outfit and she's in a dress! What a cool mid-song costume change. She's kind of a badass on stage, and her somewhat awkward movements are super easy to forgive because she's projecting the cool energy. I've seen a number of live shows up close and personal, and I can really respect how tiring it is. It's raining on stage and this girl is drenched. I hope that was the last song for the night, my goodness. Get that young woman a towel.

**Mary’s Song (Oh My My My)**

My wife has an older sister named Mary, and she listened this album as a teen. I wonder if she felt a way about this song. Oh, there's a line about kissing, that turned this thought around pretty quick. I'm gonna show this note to my wife and see if she hits me.

This song actually reminds me a little bit of Colin Hay's song Maggie. The relationships they describe are totally different, but the feelings they get across hit me in the same way.

**Our Song [\(Music Video\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb2stN7kH28&amp;list=PL12E43D243BEF14F2&amp;index=20)**

Alright! This song started in a car instead of a truck. We're making progress. I actually know this chorus because I heard my wife listening to it one time in 2009. Y'know, I was a romantic and sensitive teenager. But I was NOT the audience for music like this. I didn't fantasize about being in love with someone else. I fantasized about them being in love with me. That's a thought to save for therapy maybe.

Wow, this is the first music video where I think Taylor looks hot. Especially the scene where she's on the phone. The song itself is too country for me, and the bedazzled acoustic guitar isn't what I would've picked, but it's eye catching. To be honest, the wardrobe choices have gone downhill since the phone scene. I do like how she changes her delivery when she repeats the part about how he's talking slow. See what I mean about her loving to be in the passenger's seat over other people's cars!?

**I’m Only Me When I’m With You (Music Video)**

That was a pretty casual listen. No thoughts.

What? You thought I was terminally long-winded? You think I'm hitting this word count for FUN? ...I kind of am. On to the music video, and holy cow Taylor looks cute in a beanie. I'm taking a guess now that winter is her season and she's at her best when she's cozy. Might not be accurate with all the dresses and such that I've seen so far, but that's where my head's at. This is a super fun music video, using a bunch of candid video from Taylor's life with family and friends. She seems like a lot of fun to have around.

**Invisible**

This is a tough one for me to vibe with. I'm a confident person who doesn't struggle to command the attention of people around me when I want it. If I'm not being seen, it's usually because I want it that way. I can appreciate where she's coming from with this song, but it isn't doing anything particularly captivating for me personally. This is one where I have to step back and say, I hope the people who appreciate this song are able to get what they need from it.

**A Perfectly Good Heart**

These last three songs have melded together for me into a sort of weak tail to the album. Similar to the last song, I have a hard time connecting to the lyrics because I don't have the personal emotional experience to draw from - my wife, who I've been with for almost 15 years, was my first serious girlfriend. I'm not about to dive into a series of bittersweet memories of past relationships ending, because it's just never happened. I'm aware that may handicap my experience a little bit, but I have to be authentic to myself here. 

**Beautiful Eyes EP (2007)**

Yes, I'm doing this first EP along with the first album. WHY? Because it's got the first song I really like! I Heart Question Mark is my number 1 pick for early Taylor Swift Song of the Era. My wife was a fan of hers at the time and she'd never heard it, which means I am now the resident Taylor Swift Expert in this household, and as such my word is law. What a banger.

**Beautiful Eyes [\(Music Video\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqwIgy8ByFo)**

This is another song where Taylor is saying 'let me love you.' We've got a lot of longing going on in this early era. I get that this song isn't specifically about that theme but I'm picking up on some insecurity here. 

Post-wiki reading Alex here, and yeah I was on to something! 

This music video tells it's story in the most digestible way for me so far. I'm getting more of Taylor's candid personality, which is great, and I'm getting to be part of the party. Not every music video can be this relaxed, of course. Most of the time there's a higher level of production and something to prove, but for this one I'm really happy to be chilling with Taylor.

**I Heart?**

This song is fun! First one I definitely would've listened to unironically. Vonda Shepard would be proud. This song is a little funny, a little sad, but stays upbeat. That's my jam. If someone had played this for me when it came out I might have avoided thinking Taylor Swift was awful for a decade.

Post-wiki reading Alex here, and yeah I've listened to this half a dozen times while cleaning up part 1 for posting on reddit! It's good! Something I didn't explain well up to this point is that I don't mind a little banjo or some twang; I like bluegrass, I just don't like pop country very much. This song was a little further from the rest of what she's done up to this point and I'll be damned it isn't pretty funny too. I got what I wanted out of early T Swizzle after all.

**What's Next?**

Next up, The Holiday Collection, Fearless, Speak Now, and a handful of one-off tracks before Red is published. Thanks to anybody who actually read all that, and I hope you stick with me as things continue to develop. I've already written entries up to Red but I don't want to go too crazy on this first post.

TaylorSwift,Am I the only one who’s over the “meeting Taylor” discourse?,"Call me an old Swiftie (this will be my fifth tour), but Twitter Swifties have been annoying me in the run-up to tour with tweets about meeting Taylor — and I can’t even imagine what’s it’s like on TikTok. Tweeting their exact seat location or even putting it in their bios so TN knows, so many tweets about “don’t post if TN has DM’ed you,” saying they can’t wait to see people get that tap on the shoulder to meet her, etc. 

I get it, meeting Taylor would be awesome; we all appreciate her immensely and love her work. But it’s not the end all be all, and at the end of the day, she’s a human being, not a mythical creature. Call me jaded from living in LA, but celebrities are just people and they’re not going to change your life just because you’ve met them. 

I also think everything I’m saying doesn’t even matter because I HIGHLY doubt she’ll be doing a Rep Room type thing this tour. COVID still exists, and I’m guessing this tour will be treated like a film production — masking, testing, contact tracing. They’re not putting hundreds of millions of dollars at risk. Not to mention the distance and privacy she’s established in the last few years. Plus the fact that’s she’s a full 33-year-old woman with a life outside of being a fan-pleaser. 

TLDR: I’m sick of the talk about how to meet Taylor/people trying to get TN’s attention, especially when it’s most likely for zero reason. 

I hope I don’t sound too “get off my lawn,” I’m happy that tour is around the corner and will bring swifties joy, myself included! This is my favorite swiftie community, so I’d love to know what you guys think.",0.96,1865,0,1865,accidentalkentuckian,2023-03-15 10:37:24,11rriik,t3_11rriik

My fav met gala look of hers would easily be 2014. The dress, the hair, the makeup was all just perfection, though I think the met gala has definitely become more known for more show-stopping/extravagant looks in recent years (eg. the looks of the queen of the met gala herself &amp; Taylor’s bestie, Blake Lively) and so a look like that might not really make a splash at today’s met galas. I’m forever devastated Taylor didn’t attend the 2018 met gala (theme: ""Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination"") which was easily the best and most well-executed theme probably in met gala history.",0.99,1834,0,1834,frenchfruit,2023-04-29 18:30:14,1330801,t3_1330801

TaylorSwift,I actually really like that there are no meet and greet opportunities on this tour,"At least, to my knowledge there isn’t. I haven’t seen anything akin to say, rep room, on this tour. 

When I went to rep, we had floor seats and we saw people who purposefully placed themselves in aisles and back behind crowds in hopes that they’d get tapped by TN or Andrea to meet Taylor. Idk, something about it rubbed me the wrong way. Everyone should do them, but it felt like they prioritized a chance to meet her over enjoying the show experience. It seemed like a waste of time to me, at least. There’s 70,000 people there! What’s the likelihood that’ll work? 

And before every tour, there’s countless threads about “how to meet Taylor” or the best way to “get seen” by a member of her team. Most of which included spending an ungodly amount of money on certain seats, elaborate costumes and signage, etc. It then becomes a contest of how much money you can spend.

It’s awesome that people have gotten that opportunity, but I feel like it cheapens the experience of meeting her and turns it into some kind of competition or sport. Ever since night 1 of the eras tour where no such meet and greet took place, I’ve really enjoyed not hearing people make that a sole focus.

Folklore had the prettiest cover, and yet it has all these alternative covers. Evermore has the worst picture, and has no alternative covers. Makes me sad.

TaylorSwift,Unpopular opinion: Taylor Swift has ruined the experience of watching a music video.,"Before you say anything, let me be clear that I love Taylor Swift’s music and her music videos. I’ve been a fan since Debut and I’m always ready to watch any of her videos, new and old. 

My main issue is that she seems more focused on the Easter eggs of it all rather than the actual storytelling that music videos are known for. For example, the “I Can See You” music video is basically ALL Easter eggs and not much of a story that’s even relevant to the vibe of the song. 

I know fans love to Easter egg hunt in her videos and sleuth out what Taylor might be hinting at next, but it feels like (to me) the Easter eggs take away from the present and have you itching for what’s next. I’m not trying to shame anybody for doing so or enjoying the journey of doing it. 

Her old videos were simple in that they told the story of the song (i.e. “Love Story”, “Wildest Dreams”). Seems like ever since Reputation she’s been making videos that allude to what’s in the future for her career or whatever’s going on with anyone in relation to her career.

I guess one could argue that she’s now telling the story of her career. And maybe other artists have done this as well, but I’m only aware of Taylor doing it since she’s so famous. I just wish it was less “look at this and that and what meaning it has” and more “here’s the story”. 

I know this is definitely going to be unpopular, but does anyone else think the same?",0.83,1814,0,1814,Smallville_Kansas,2023-08-01 20:38:00,15fkvg0,t3_15fkvg0

TaylorSwift,For new fans: 1989 Tracklist Background History,"1. **Welcome To New York:** A co-write with OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder. This is the opening track because 1989 was a transformative era for Taylor. She cut her hair short, ditched the ""teardrops on my guitar"" country girl aesthetic and modernised her sound/image. She moved to New York, something she'd wanted to do for a while, even referenced it in Mean (""someday I'll be living in a big ol' city"" as a backdrop of NY appears behind her in the music video). The album, and this song, signifies change in sound, location and outlook. It was also significant because of the lyric ""you can want who you want/boys and boys and girls and girls"". It was still a big deal for celebrities to show LGBTQIA+ support at the time, if you can imagine! (Same sex marriage wasn't even legalised yet!) and there was some surprise she included the lyric, probably from the ongoing assumption that she was more conservative (and her country background).
2. **Blank Space:** This song tackles the media narrative of ""Careful, she'll write a song about you!"" and ""She intentionally destroys relationships for songs"". In 2012/2013, that narrative had quickly turned from a light in-joke she was okay with telling to legitimate backlash and a way for people to undermine or handwave her artistry. So she took the backlash and, in a similar move to adopting the snake imagery for Reputation, said ""Well let's see what that would look like if it were somehow true/the real me"". At the time, ""Darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream"" was considered an iconic lyric and the song was/is considered an example of her best songwriting.
3. **Style:** Yes, this song is about Harry *Style*s. She can be seen holding his paper airplane necklace at the beginning and end of the music video. She explained the song was about someone you're never truly done with, as she was still privately/casually seeing Harry during 2013-2014. A few songs on 1989 establish this (as does the album's secret message, I'll post that at the end).
4. **Out of the Woods:** This song marks the arrival of the Jack Antonoff/Taylor Swift musical chemistry we know and love today. Yes, they'd done Sweeter Than Fiction prior to this but this album is where Taylor and Jack solidified their musical bond/sound. This song is again about Harry, from the perspective of hindsight. Looking back at the fast paced relationship and noticing all the mistakes or things she needn't have worried about at the time (""the monsters turned out to be just trees""). Similar to All Too Well, she uses ""I remember"", ""I remember thinking"" as a storytelling device. This is also one of the first songs where fans began to emphasise how amazing her bridges were. Lyrically, she references the snowmobile crash she and Harry had, where he had to get stitches in his chin and is speculated by fans to be the ""ok fun is over"" point of the relationship where Harry began to drift away and things weren't quite the same again. There's a neat double meaning in ""Remember when we hit the brakes too soon?"" - both the literal snowmobile brakes that caused the crash, and Harry leaving seemingly at random while on holiday with her in January 2013, after a year of pining for each other in 2012, only to come back *again* some time later in 2013. The song was used in early promo for the album. She performed it many times in the lead-up to 1989's release, despite it not being an official single until the end of 2015. The music video is also one of the first times I can remember the easter eggs really becoming a thing, I remember her on Tumblr praising everyone for picking up on a number of things.
5. **All You Had To Do Was Stay:** Taylor has described how the song came to her because she had a dream that her voice was unusually high pitched and all she could say was ""stay!"". I think this song is again speaking to Harry about his initial hasty exit.
6. **Shake It Off:** Can you believe there was discourse around this music video? Shake It Off was an instant signature song/hit with the locals overnight. Again it works into the new outlook of ""I'm not that sad girl anymore!"" and tries to playfully address the talking points about her image/dating life/personality/awkwardness etc. Right when it was a huge inescapable radio hit, people began to take issue with the twerking in the video, saying Taylor was making fun of black culture, despite all the diversity present in the music video otherwise. This was one year after Miley's infamous VMA performance and right at the same time as Nicki Minaj's Anaconda was released). What's more likely to be the case is that Taylor was, up til that point, always seen as very ""safe"" and decidedly ""non-sexual"" (which made the slut shaming all the more nonsensical) and the presence of twerking dancers, as well as Taylor in an outfit she never would've been caught dead in prior, was a way of addressing that part of her image as gone now (or on the way out). Specifically [the part here](https://youtu.be/nfWlot6h_JM?t=93) where she is literally pointing to her hips and making a shocked expression. This era was all about changing minds and making people see her differently, so those scenes were much more likely to be saying ""bet you never thought you'd see me this way!"" than anything else.
7. **I Wish You Would:** Not a lot of lore around this one except the secret message and I think something Taylor said in a Secret Session suggests it's about Harry. Or is what she hoped he was doing at that point in time (pining for her and driving past her house).
8. **Bad Blood:** Taylor clarified early on that this song was addressing a woman, not a man (again, the ""I'm different now"" outlook, she didn't want to be defined solely by relationships or breakup songs). She explained that, in the past, she never fully knew where she stood with Katy Perry, basically got ""fake friend"" vibes from her. That seemed to be confirmed when Katy hired Red Tour dancers for her own upcoming tour, before the Red Tour was finished. A lot of people expressed confusion as to why this would cause a rift but my general theory is that a tour is so timed and choreographed to perfection, that losing a number of dancers at random could potentially throw timing and set/costuming changes into disarray. Which is perhaps why Taylor view it as a move of deliberate sabotage. Some have also speculated that Katy dating John Mayer around this time might've contributed to the ongoing tension. Despite its success, the song has always been one of Taylor's least popular and most criticised. The music video, featuring dozens of famous women preparing to fight with Taylor against an enemy, was also criticised for playing into ""girl fight"" stereotypes and pitting women against each other. The music video and surrounding hype is probably where a lot of what went down in 2016 began to bubble under the surface.
9. **Wildest Dreams:** Even today, speculation runs wild (ha) about who this song is about, if anyone. Guesses range from Harry, to Alexander Skarsgaard to Matthew Gray Gubler (?). Skarsgaard is a convincing guess considering they'd just starred in The Giver together, he is incredibly tall (and Taylor is tall too, so if she points it out, he must be very tall!), and they filmed in Africa where the music video takes place. There was discourse aimed at this music video too, this time for not featuring any actors of colour despite taking place in Africa (even though it's a Hollywood film crew in the 50s.........). Lyrically, Taylor continues taking her usual stance/the usual assumptions about her and flipping it. No more starry eyed enchantment, she knows they're going to break up at some point. She's not going in thinking ""He might be the one"", she's thinking ""He'll be fun while it lasts"". A year or so before this, no one would've expected her to write this way. The music video features Scott Eastwood, son of iconic actor Clint Eastwood.
10. **How You Get The Girl:** This continues the general storyline of ""Guy who walked out is now back, what should I do"" and Taylor aimed for it to be a step by step manual for men to use!
11. **This Love:** This song was written back in 2012, originally as a poem that she one day ended up turning into a song. The common assumption is she wrote it when she realised she and Harry had a real shot at dating in October 2012, after first meeting in March 2012 then their schedules and other relationships occupied them for most of the year.
12. **I Know Places:** The second Ryan Tedder co-write on the album. This one was written in response to her current life status, being a huge star and having people hounding/stalking her constantly. She was asking herself ""Who would want this?"" and wrote a song expressing to a lover that she does in fact know how to keep things private. Again, this album is all about perception and changing minds. It's interesting (but understandable) how much this theme has come up in her work since. ""Who could leave/who could stay?"" in The Archer, ""Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?"" in Peace and ""Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"" on King of My Heart.
13. **Clean:** I actually believe this song to be a cleverly placed, hidden in plain sight ode to the Red era and specifically a final goodbye to her feelings for Jake. She has completed her transformation, changed all the minds, changed her outlook and her actual look, and now feels like she's finally moved on from that whole time. The assumption is the song would be about Harry because it's on the ""Harry album"" but the date on the [polaroid for the song's recording session](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fjlep1pvshzf41.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D9406b50f4a64317827d8752914d3332455323969) shows Feb 9 2014. She was still very much ""on"" with Harry at that point, she would record Style just ten days later. ""10 months older"" as the lyrics suggest, would go back to April 2013, possibly earlier depending on when she began the song. The ""months and months of back and forth"", the ""wine stained dress"",""lost the war"", framing going back to an ex as a type of addiction, never wanting to end up in that type of situation again - it all suggests the Jake dynamic much more than the Harry one.

**Bonus Tracks:**

* **Wonderland:** This is widely accepted to be another song detailing the late 2012 chaos of dating Harry, along the lines of the anxiety/chaos in Out of the Woods.
* **You Are In Love:** Taylor was inspired by Jack's relationship with Lena Dunham because she wanted to write about a deep type of love she believed she hadn't experienced yet. Lena discourse aside, what intrigues me the most is how Taylor was adamant in clarifying she had not been in love like this before.
* **New Romantics:** The fan favourite actually doesn't have any lore behind it! Really the only noteworthy things would be the highlight lyric: ""we show off our different scarlet letters/trust me, mine is better"" - that's basically Blank Space summarised in a single line! And the song eventually becoming the second song on the 1989 Tour setlist, which isn't typical for bonus tracks but goes to show how popular it was.

**Album Cover:**

There's been some talk about the change from the serious, almost anonymous original photo to the bright, happy smiling Taylor's Version. The Lover diaries revealed when Taylor was preparing the album, she did originally choose a smiling photo as the cover. But in a dream, she saw the cover she ended up choosing and immediately changed it when she woke up. She also [mentioned on Tumblr](https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/184718022200340807/) that the chosen cover was ""all about the mystery"" which really goes in line with everything I've said here about leaving behind all previous assumptions/images/anything remotely recognisable and starting fresh with new ideas and no assumptions. So I think it's a lovely full circle moment that she is now smiling brightly on her version because IMO it means she's left behind the ""run away from yourself/change everything about yourself"" mentality and is fine being herself. I also wonder if the bonus tracks might contextualise the change as well.

**The album's secret message:**

1. “Welcome to New York”: We begin our story in New York.
2. “Blank Space”: There once was a girl known by everyone and no one.
3. “Style”: Her heart belonged to someone who couldn’t stay.
4. “Out of the Woods”: They loved each other recklessly.
5. “All You Had to Do Was Stay”: They paid the price.
6. “Shake It Off”: She danced to forget him.
7. “I Wish You Would”: He drove past her street each night.
8. “Bad Blood”: She made friends and enemies.
9. “Wildest Dreams”: He only saw her in his dreams.
10. “How You Get the Girl”: Then one day he came back.
11. “This Love”: Timing is a funny thing.
12. “I Know Places”: And everyone was watching.
13. “Clean”: She lost him but she found herself and somehow that was everything.

The final line can be seen at the start and end of the Out of the Woods music video, and was also shown on the big screens at the end of the 1989 Tour.

TaylorSwift,The Taylor's Versions were the best thing that happened to Taylor,"The TVs pretty much shattered the notion of an artist's greatest hits collection. They allowed old and new fans alike to rediscover her entire discography and re-appreciate the greatness of Taylor's musicianship from when she was a hopeless romantic teen, and raised the value of her old and unreleased songs.

Other artists would be a bit ashamed of their older material, but not Taylor. She embraces all that cheese and heartbreak before and turned into a celebration for her fans. I didn't feel awkward AT ALL that a 33-year-old Taylor sung juvenilia from her 17-year-old self. 

Having said, looking forward to the rest of the TVs -- esp Reputation!",0.99,1787,0,1787,imoogiheap,2023-05-07 05:50:13,13abwqe,t3_13abwqe

TaylorSwift,Any other Swifties who were never in a relationship or just no actual dating experience?,"No flings, nothing lol. As in quite literally never been touched. I went out w a guy a couple times in college and was super into him at first but decided nah (that was a decade ago) . I have been on some dates this year but eh. Idk.

Anyways so I’m curious bc if you just kind of pretend to relate to a lot of her songs or if you make up stories in your head. I do both, concerning me specifically and with fictional characters, bc it’s fun! I love her ability to create stories and as a story artist myself it’s super interesting and inspiring.

Bc I know a lot of people probably relate directly to her music. I think w the release TV of speak now (and the fact I’m thinking a lot about a female coworker in That Way) I’ve been thinking more how I missed out on “normal young person experiences” and feeling sad. 😭😂 I just wanna relate to other swifties like that!!!!
But side note I went to eras tour in Seattle and it was pretty perfect!!!

Also also I didn’t become an extreme hardcore fan til midnights 😳

Edit: to clarify I definitely do want a relationship and experience attraction even if it was more rare for me IRL until the last two years. It took a long time for me to experience it more often IRL and I think part of that was anxiety disorders and discomfort with the idea of intimacy. it should absolutely be normalized as a normal part of sexuality but it does not mean you are inherently incapable of attraction or that kind of intimacy!",0.94,1763,0,1763,maybelletea,2023-07-29 19:09:18,15cxeah,t3_15cxeah

It just leaves me wondering why because nothing about her has changed. She dances at award shows but now instead of hating on her for it people find it endearing and fun. Her tickets are a hot commodity. Everyone talks about her now.

So I just wanted to know if anyone has an idea of why this change in public opinion happened. Are people just finally realizing they don’t have to pretend to hate her?

Please don’t bring signs. She very more than likely will not interact with them and they just block the view of those behind you. 
Please don’t throw things on stage. Bras, toys, gifts, flowers, anything. They are a hazard and could injure Taylor or anyone else on stage. 

Do not rush the floor. 
Do not be rude to security or venue staff. 
We do not want any accidents or stampedes or riots. We as a group need to pretend we’re on a field trip and we’re representing our school, so we need to be on our best behavior. 

The entire world is now paying attention and we need to give her, and ourselves as fans, a good name in the court of public opinion. 

Have fun at the show, just remember to be respectful and safe.

TaylorSwift,Concert etiquette just bad?! Can we not film a whole concert?!,"Had an amazing time at the concert last night. I was fortunate to have floor, but not fortunate to have multiple people in front of me filming almost every song. I get it! You’re excited! But my view for most the show was the cameras in front of me. I’m amazed how many people cannot live in the present.

On top of that, I had two, what I would call, coked out cheerleading minions (very erratic behavior, and constant chattering). They arrived halfway thru Majorie and kept tapping my shoulder asking if I was in their seats (I wasn’t).  Unconvinced, they crouched on my seat until the song ended asking if I could move (I wasn’t in there seat). Finally they figured out how numbers work and found their seat. During the show, they spent their time filming themselves singing every song with the flash on near my face and standing on chairs (the people behind them also not happy) .  When they were let filming themselves having “so much fun” or standing on the chairs, they sat down and looked miserable. It was bizzare 

You can have a great time and not be a dick: any other thoughts?

EDIT: I want to point out the people filming in front of me really impacted my view. I had a very tall man two rows up. That’s fine, it’s not his fault he’s tall. But then all around him were three women all filming the entire show. I’m trying to look around the tall man only to have phones blocking my view. It was very hard to get a glimpse of Taylor. Mostly had to watch the screen

I’m also not saying don’t film, I’m asking people just be curteous. If you want a phone up the whole time, maybe floor ain’t for you

MORE EDIT: people are taking this really personally and attacking me for being more focused on others. I can make an observation without letting it ruin my experience. Also I’m clearly not attacking all the people who say they have a very specific disability that requires them to record (😐). So chill with your main character syndrome.

I don't know if I'm seeming like a ""oh people have no manners nowadays!"" but I feel like people are filming concerts and trying to get the most viral moment.

TaylorSwift,Trying to thank the nice people who sat next to me,"Hi I know this is a long shot, but I was at the Saturday Philly show in the last row of section 218. 

I had driven 5 hours to go to the show alone. I have an extreme crippling social anxiety when it comes to initiating any type of interaction with anyone so I do everything alone. 

A group sat next to me and asked one woman asked if I was alone and when I said I was she told me I was one of them now. I chatted with her and one of her friends throughout the night. At one point they put glitter on my face. Which was super rad, because I wanted to do something like dress up or the friendship brackets or whatever but it just felt weird to do knowing I would likely just go not talk to anyone and leave. 

Anyway right as the show ended they hurried out before I noticed. 

I know it’s highly unlikely they would see this, but I just wanted to say thanks. It was so nice to feel like a normal person that has friends and hangs out with people for a night. I would have loved the show regardless, but y’all really made it so much more special.",0.99,1641,0,1641,therobgeorge,2023-05-16 02:43:16,13iq1kt,t3_13iq1kt

TaylorSwift,PSA: We need to start disputing charges from the merch store that don't show up and aren't refunded promptly.,"I've seen a lot of posts in this and other Taylor subs about people not receiving their merchandise (or broken merch!), and when they try to contact customer service, they get a run-around or hear nothing back.

In my case, I preordered 1989TV as soon as I was able to and never received it. I tried to contact customer service. They offered a refund, but never came through. I followed up. Crickets. A week later, two different people from CS contacts me with a whole run around about getting the item. I got fed up. I could just go to Target and buy it. 

So, I called my credit card company and filed a dispute. Got my money back the same day. You should do it too if you are in the same situation. (You can also do it with a debit card if you've kept your paper trail, but it's a bit harder.) You should also do it if CS offers you a replacement and it doesn't show up within a reasonable amount of time.

I know it's not Tay's fault- this is on CS for not fixing an obvious problem. If we ALL start disputing these charges, they *will* do something about it. Especially if the issue ends up on a high-up exec's desk, or, ideally, brought to her attention. She's always been great to her fans, and I'm certain that in the case she was alerted to such a huge problem things would change.

Dispute your charges! Let's make them get their shit together!

TaylorSwift,** Important Safety Tips for Taylor’s Hot Weather Concerts**,"Hello,

I work in health &amp; safety in the arts &amp; entertainment industry. I want to pass on some safety tips for Taylor’s Rio shows, and any shows that will occur in hot weather. Some of this is common sense, some of it may be new informations. Apologies for formatting issues if any occur, I normally don’t make these kind of posts.

**2-3 days before the concert:**
- begin hydrating 24 hours before the concert. This means drinking plenty of water, and avoiding any alcohol
- Avoid any hot weather 24 hours  before the concert. This means avoiding excessive sweating or putting your body into temperature varying environments
- If you have had heat exhaustion or stroke before, you are predisposed to have it happen again and at a quicker rate
- Read up on heat illness (heat cramps, exhaustion, heat stroke). Be informed and be prepared. 


**Day of concert/ while waiting outdoors:**
- Pack water, and electrolytes ( example: Gatorade, salty snacks). Consume in regular intervals. You need more than you think
- Pack a hat, something to cover your neck, and an umbrella while standing in line. 
- If you really don’t want to pack an umbrella (although you can be a good neighbour and invite people under it, or pass it around the crowd to help provide relief), seek **“hard shade”**. Hard shade is when you can no longer see your shadow within the shade. *ETA:* don’t bring an umbrella you care about, you may have to ditch it once you’re inside the stadium
- Fans (handheld or little battery operated hand fans) DO NOT WORK in temperatures over 35C (95F)
- Pack a couple of paper towels in your purse. If you have cool water, spare a little bit to put on paper towel and place on the back of your neck. Keeping your core body temperature down is essential 
- I know it’s not necessarily the chicest, but consider wearing linens. Trust me, hot sweat skin-to-skin in a hot environment is terrible. A linen barrier helps stay cool


**Once Inside:**
- I know you want that sweet sweet front row spot, but purchase as many water bottles as you can once inside. You don’t want to rely on those pitiful cups being handed out by security 
- purchase a few small, salty snacks or electrolyte drinks. You need to make sure you’re replenishing your salt intake, as you will lose a lot through your skin. Pounding water without a small salt balance alone will not prevent heat illness, and in extreme cases can lead to hyponatremia ( a dangerous electrolyte imbalance)
- When you’re positioned in your spot for the show,  ask yourself: **where are the nearest exits? Do I see a first aid tent? Did I check where the nearest washrooms are? Are there any obstacles to my quick exit in an emergency?** Have fun, but maintain situational awareness. If you become dizzy or sick, you don’t want to be thinking about this on the fly.


**IF YOU START TO FEEL SYMPTOMS:**
- you’re ok if you feel hot and uncomfortable, but if begin to feel dizzy or panicked, are gasping for air, or get an extreme headache, GET OUT and either move to an exit for relief and fresh air, or find the first aid tent/ security guard for help.  They can provide aid, and you’re more likely to catch the end of the show this way. 
- If you see others around you fading, call for help. Wave your arms, make eye contact with security etc. and get them out. Not only could you be saving a life, the person could faint and knock people over which can lead to crowd crush ( like at Travis Scott’s show)

I’m probably forgetting lots of useful tips, and if I remember I’ll add them in the comments. 

At the end of the day, you’ll have a much greater chance of making it to the end of the show happy and healthy if you remain aware of the risks and heavily prepare in advance. 

I hope this helps Rio and all hot weather Taylor Swift shows. Feel free to ask questions and I’ll try to answer! 

**ETA:** foreign travellers should have some basic translations saved to their phone on a digital note pad (something that doesn’t require wifi/ data). You want to be able to pull these messages up on your phone to show the person you’re trying to communicate with. There’s no way you’ll verbally fumble through a foreign language when you’re in medical distress. Trust me, I’ve been there myself. There are large text apps that people usually use to make DJ requests that could work well if you’re trying to get security’s attention in a crowd. 

Examples:
- “ Please help, I am very sick”
- “ I need an ambulance” 
- “ Help! Take me to First Aid”
- “ I really need water”
- “ I can’t breath” 
- “ Help! Someone has fainted” (then you can lead them to where or try to point to the area)

TaylorSwift,Can we point our disappointment towards those who really deserve it regarding last night?,"The people that posted Taylor’s location to the entire world for internet points. Disgusting. 

There really should be a law. Don’t make Taylor be the one that has to make boundaries between her and her fans public law. We would MUCH rather her her making us music and art. 

Reddit is the perfect place to say this where our entire public identity is internet points. 

I refuse to say Taylor is to big to have friends. I refuse to believe she cannot attend her friend’s wedding without her friends being booed for demanding some privacy. 

In the words of someone I heard one one time, if you posted or showed up at last night YNTCD… your entitlement. If you want something from Taylor? You can pay for it. Stop trying to take what is not yours.

Edit - I’d like to clarify when I said there should be a law I really mean stalking laws need to be expanded. 

Traveling somewhere with the express reason to run into someone is unhinged, and providing location to enable that should have consequences. 

I hope I can trust this won’t be twisted to far extremes as some like to do, and have to see anyone say “what, I can’t go surprise my wife with lunch at work?” Or anything like that. I do mean you shouldn’t find out where the cute barista shops and go try and run into her. 

Taylor shouldn’t have to take that on for all of us, but sooner or later she may.",0.93,1597,0,1597,Fresh_Beet,2023-08-20 01:23:42,15vuyl7,t3_15vuyl7

2. Taylor Swift says Justin Timberlake is the Frank Sinatra of this generation. I actually paused it and rewatched it to check that was what she said.

TaylorSwift,Has Taylor turned us into gluttons?,"*please correct me if I mess up any of these facts.

During the Eras tour, she has:

-played for over three hours straight dancing and singing her heart out
-announced TWO re-recordings of Taylor’s version 
-given us two new music videos, which she premiered at the show 
-played 44+ songs each show 
-has given us two surprise songs each show (which always leads to disappointment or heartache)
-has had multiple surprise guests 
-added extra shows to several cities and countries 

She has FED us.  But I feel like it’s to the point where we are no longer full, and we need more and more.  

I’m already reading theories about when reputation  will be released, and we haven’t even enjoyed 1989 yet! 

Every show, we want (and almost expect) some sort of huge announcement or surprise.  Some are upset at the surprise songs we received (LA this doesn’t apply to you lol)

I am 1000% guilty of this. Do you think she is starting to feel we are ungrateful? 😂😂😂. I am sooo thankful for her, and I admire her so much.  I do, however, have to remind myself sometimes that she is human and not a dancing monkey that performs at our command.  

We used to go at least a year, if not way longer,  without any new recordings or albums, but the past five months WE HAVE GOTTEN SO MUCH. 

Idk, maybe she lives for this and enjoys it.  I wonder if she will ever get to a point where she feels like she’s given too much and has nothing left to give 

Just to add, we love you, Taylor swift, and we appreciate everything you do! Please take a break and relax 😂",0.95,1549,0,1549,Ok-Aside552,2023-08-12 03:38:15,15or9h3,t3_15or9h3

TaylorSwift,All the nurses working on my top surgery today were Swifties!,"Today in the early morning hours I had gender affirming top surgey! 🥳 And while I was waiting to be rolled into the operating room, I overheard a crowd of like five different nurses on the ward gushing about their tickets for Taylor Swift's upcoming show here in Chicago and I chatted them up. I was already on an IV of pre-op anti-anxiety meds so that made me extra bold.

It was such a lovely, random little moment that helped me feel at ease before a procedure that I've wanted for years but been afraid to undergo. Thanks for making the world a little friendlier today, Swiftie nurses. This kid was not on his own today. 

Anyone else had a random moment of bonding over Taylor Swift's music like this?

TaylorSwift,I wonder if this is simply the Taylor that we would've gotten post-2016 if Joe and her never met,"DISCLAIMER: I do NOT make this post with any intention of condoning Taylor's decision to date this scumbag. I myself am a female POC and while yes yes yes never idolize celebrities because they're strangers you've never met and never will, I've been incredibly disappointed in her choices recently, because it's one thing to be a little heartbroken and immature and date an edgelord, it is another thing to date one who casually talks about beating it to brutalizing videos of POC, another to date one who beats it to brutalizing videos of POC and proudly parade him around, and another one to date an edgelord who beats it to brutalizing videos of POC and proudly parade him around and get your PR team to post fluff pieces about him to try to unsully his image after you spent years using 'feminism' to promote your image. This is just an observation and I was wondering if other people agree or had their takes on it.

I remember a Reddit post from about a year ago that said ""what do you think reputation would've sounded like if Taylor never met Joe?"" Obviously a lot of the comments were ""it would've been much darker"" ""it probably would've been a complete image shift of everything we thought taylor was"" ""she would've been so much more lonely"" ""maybe taylor would've turned to drugs from having almost nobody dependable outside her immediate family to turn to"". That post really stood out to me because, like I'm sure most of us feel, I cannot really imagine reputation if she hadn't found love at the time. She probably would've continued dating around, had a few songs sprinkled in about some whirlwind toxic romance which she seemed to fall into repeatedly in her 20's as signaled by her music (Style, Getaway Car, High Infidelity, Wildest Dreams). But ultimately she would have had no positive light in her life, nothing to really clutch onto.

It always seemed astounding to me that a kid who got catapulted to being objectively the biggest musical star of her time and famous since *16*, on top of being a self-described insecure hopeless romantic who tends to falls for toxic intense men who do not care about her, then groomed/manipulated at just 19 years old, seemed to not be... cracking? I am amazed that the unhealthiest thing she (publicly) ever ended up having was an eating disorder- it just seemed crazy considering that other young female stars like Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, all fell deep into the dark world of drugs, trouble with the law, and hospitalizations. Taylor Swift was thrown into as many magazine articles, tabloids, photos, nasty gossip and slandering as all of them, arguably more, yet she kept succeeding.

Then, after all that, in 2016 the GP officially turned on her for good and I cannot imagine what it must've been like to be praised your entire adult life for being the ""good girl"" ""America's sweetheart"" and instilled to a manic level that not only your livelihood, your legacy, your work, but also your worth as a human being is tied up in how much the public likes you/your music since you were *sixteen* to being universally shat on for no real reason and having revenge porn made of your body. I mean, yeah  rich people problems but come on man that's gotta do some serious mental damage. Yet she didn't go crazy after 2016. She instead just put out another romance-centered album with some darker colors on it and continued being Taylor Swift. She got into the healthiest relationship she ever had, learned to cope with her eating disorder, while magically gaining the ability to keep her love life incredibly private.

It seemed like the craziest plot twist ever, almost too good to be true. I hate to do the sexist thing of ascribe her success to the man behind her, her legacy is 100% thanks to her mind, but you can't deny that this incredible turn of events must've at least partially been because of the love and support provided to her very dearly by Joe.

And, as relationships all the time come to a natural end, this one did too. Except, I feel like it was kind of the thing that saved her from the worst time in her life. Sooooo, when it ended, I wonder if that 2016 extreme loneliness, feeling of being lost, having nothing much real and long-standing around you, being a workaholic to escape your problems, spiraling out and making careless decisions in romance not caring who it hurts, is simply what Taylor fell back into after Joe. I wonder, had it not been for that anomaly of luck she got by finding him, if this type of shocking behavior is what would've happened post-2016 anyway.

EDIT: A number of commentors have found it distasteful I used the word grooming, my apologies. I was unaware but it seems that grooming is a word for a case where the older person has known the victim since childhood and works on the case for a while.

TaylorSwift,Managing fan expectations at The Eras Tour (and possibly onward),"This may be an uncomfortable conversation to some diehard fans, but I believe it's a needed one.

Ever since The Eras Tour was announced and ticket sales went live, I've been seeing a lot of social media posts, especially on TikTok, of tips and strategies to get noticed by Taylor and/or her team in order to meet her.

I will preface this by saying that while I would absolutely love the opportunity to meet her, **I had to come to terms with myself that it most likely will never happen in my lifetime**. And I need to be okay with it, and so do you, and there's a good reason why:

We all know how big Taylor is; this tour is probably the most anticipated event of hers thus far. She has millions of fans. Now, I don't know even close to a 100,000 people, let alone over a million. And the small handful of people I do know have involved scary stalker situations and I know Taylor has those too. So I can't imagine the stressful situations I've been in - but amplified by the limelight that is Taylor Swift.

In interviews, she has mentioned having to carry wound dressing with her at all times because stalkers show up unannounced at her house with weapons. She has mentioned that she stopped telling people where she is, or what events she's going to ahead of time because creepy people show up unannounced, and you just **never know what their motives are**.

For people that are desperately trying to meet her, or complain that she's not ""doing enough"" for the fans by not doing secret sessions etc. anymore, look at the Christina Grimmie tragedy. If you're not aware of it, please take a couple minutes to read about it. Taylor has a fantastic security team, but incidents like Christina's is what they're ultimately trying to prevent. Taylor has tripped on items thrown on the stage, and crazy people have grabbed her by the legs. I'll never know from her POV what it's like to have followers that have parasocial relationships with me, but I can imagine it's terrifying to think about. She is a high-profile artist. There are people who adore her, and then there are people who adore her **too much to the point where it endangers her**. And if I were her, I would take ZERO RISKS if it meant preserving my safety so that I can continue to perform and create for my fans. It's a double-edged sword; I know she loves her fans, but if she got seriously hurt - what will happen to her career? She's thinking longevity.

So I commend her for putting up boundaries. For a long time, I wondered why she was sharing so little on social media because I liked the tour rehearsal content, but I understand now. I do believe the biggest part of it is her and her team's safety. I also believe that meet and greets, secret sessions, etc. are a thing of the past now. It made sense when she was ""smaller"" and had a manageable way of meeting people, but she's at the point in her career where it's just not feasible anymore. And it's not to be taken personally whatsoever. And I think the real fans will understand this.

I doubt Eras will have backstage meet ups. I'm unsure of her mother's health and it's not my business, but with her cancer history it's possible she's immunocompromised and with COVID still being very real, Taylor cannot take the risk of meeting anybody and getting sick and cancelling shows, as badly as she may want to or you may want to.

So for those of you who have tactics of how to get noticed by her team at tour, don't. I honestly think you will have the best time showing up, dressed to the nines, singing your heart out, and having the time of your life. If your ultimate goal is to meet her, I think you're depriving yourselves of enjoying this amazing fanbase and artwork she has produced over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT**: I was misinformed about the Watch Hill beach wall; thank you to those who pointed it out. I removed it because I have new information now and I'd like to encourage discussion that is relevant to my post instead opening a door to criticize Taylor's personal decisions. I feel that is best saved for a separate thread. I have been enjoying reading everyone's thoughts and perspectives!

TaylorSwift,Hot take: Midnights is completely misunderstood,"I used to agree with what everyone said about Midnights it was: disjointed, Surface level, and overhyped. But my opinion completely shifted after the breakup and You’re Losing Me, after these events I thought it was common knowledge but I hear people saying otherwise often, that is that all 13 songs on the main track of midnights are about the breakdown of Joe and Taylor. There is so much proof of it, like in Daylight Taylor describing how she doesn’t want to be defined by the things that keep her awake at night, and then writing her next autobiographical about just that. There is also the fact that You’re Losing Me is “from the vault” to show that it’s was written with the rest of Midnights and the only reason she couldn’t was the breakup wasn’t public yet. You’re losing me also references not only Lover songs but also Midnights songs like labyrinth. Knowing this shows how deep the album really is, all while masquerading as an album looking back at her life. Songs like Sweet Nothing turn from sappy love songs to a window into the end of this very long relationship. Looking back I feel stupid for not realizing this with Midnight Rain existing.
TL;DR
Midnights is about the breakup of Joe and Taylor and is one of her most deep and well written albums.

Edit: I forgot to mention that personally I think the album was written on/about a break in the relationship, and the album was either done or released before an “official” or final breakup. Also I am only speaking about the main 13 tracks, as I do think the 3 am editions fit the “sleepless nights from her past” with songs like Would’ve Could’ve Dhould’ve obviously being about people other than Joe",0.89,1514,0,1514,AmbassadorHefty279,2023-08-15 06:49:48,15rijqs,t3_15rijqs

TaylorSwift,My boyfriend’s reason for not liking “The Man” is the ultimate irony,"My boyfriend is a GREAT guy to start. He has listened to every album with me, let’s me play her music every time we listen to music, listens to me rant about her, and generally enjoys her music with me. 

Now, with that said… He HATES The Man. (One of my fav songs…) He says it’s tasteless because of her level of success. 

I have tried to explain to him it’s not about the level of success it’s about the hardships that women endure at any level of success. The invisible standards and abuses that we endure that men never have to deal with. 

He says at her level of fame and success she has no right to complain about these things (at which point I told him he needed to change his language because I was getting offended) but he is SO WRONG. 

Taylor is NOT complaining in The Man, but rather telling EVERYONE about the double standards and shit that women go through. 

I mean, this song speaks to me in so many ways. It speaks to my mom and my older sister. And when I was at the eras tour, it spoke directly to 74,000 other women. 

It’s more like a song that FINALLY acknowledges how hard it is to be a woman in any profession. 

My boyfriend doesn’t understand what it’s like to look over at boys and wish that I had that level of confidence or train for years to be in the shadows of men who naturally had a leg up in my sport… He doesn’t understand why I work so hard to be a respectable, wealthy, elegant woman. 

I have to work twice as men for that level of respect at least. 

The Man feels like… That push to me that I need. I would be the man if I was a man. I would be so fucking respected. Not the punchline of jokes. Certainly taken more seriously by the people around me. 

The Man is like, Taylor gets it too. That woman that I love and look up to knows how it feels too and look at her. It just feels good to be seen. 

I will not listen to any slander of The Man, especially not from a man. I love my boyfriend and he’s a total sweetheart but I thought him only seeing it as a successful woman wanting to complain was incredibly… Wrong, dumb, ironic… Tasteless. I mean it’s insane to me that he thinks inequality and hardship stops when you become a celebrity.",0.89,1515,0,1515,[deleted],2023-08-17 22:08:13,15ty6i8,t3_15ty6i8

TaylorSwift,People not appreciating the re-recordings,"I am so excited about Speak Now TV but my entire timeline has either been complaining or ripping apart every little thing they think is wrong with the re-recordings. Obviously she is going to sound different, but that’s what makes this experience unique and not to mention her vocals just sound 10x better than the original. Obviously some of the re-recordings might sound different first listens because we are so used to the originals. I love that Taylor subtly changed a few things here and there because this is how SHE wants the albums and that’s what matters. As far as people saying there seems to be a lack of emotion, I actually really disagree and would say that it seems as though she intentionally tried to emote more in SNTV than the other re-recordings. So many of the songs seem angrier or more desperate IMO. I also can get over the whole Better than Revenge lyric change because 1) it was necessary and 2) the production on Taylor’s version is simply better and goes harder 🤷🏻‍♀️ I’m proud of her",0.91,1502,0,1502,Tasty-Visual2440,2023-07-07 18:11:29,14tblqm,t3_14tblqm

TaylorSwift,I don’t like seeing ‘ex hate’ on social media.,"Now, this might be part bias as I’m a John Mayer fan as well as a swiftie. But for me, it’s unsettling seeing people drag Taylor’s exes into the mud. 

We’ve gotten enough from Taylor’s music to see where their faults are. However, I think it’s completely unfair and nonsensical to drag them into the mud over a breakup that happened over 10 years ago. 

I was thinking about it if they weren’t celebrities. Imagine deciding you don’t love your partner and leaving them. And then 10 years later all their friends start telling everyone you’re a horrible person and you won’t ever change and you shouldn’t be allowed near anyone. 

But then for Taylor’s sake, stop bringing up a relationship that happened 10 years ago. Help her heal and STOP BRINGING IT UP! If it’s on our fyp, it’s on hers. And I don’t know about you, but the last thing I’d want to be reminded of is my own heartbreak. Especially a painful one that took place more than a decade ago. 

Is it just me? Or do some people see how wrong and ignorant it is? 

Xoxo Gossip Gorl x

Edit: a John Mayer fan means a music fan before you all drag me like the nice people you are.

Edit 2: sorry for triggering some of you by mentioning John Mayer. Any exes. Joe is being dragged for what reason? Oh, no reason. For all we know they might still be together. Some of y’all are too young to be on social media and it shows.

Edit 3: what happened to Taylor - or at least what we THINK happened to Taylor is horrific. But there’s saying that someone did something wrong and then there’s sending them death threats, bringing up stories we don’t know are true. Keep yourselves to yourselves and support Taylor’s music. That’s why we’re here.

Edit 4: the thing that’s scary is the ‘John you’re next’. Like next what? Next to be bullied by 12 year olds? What about the next new Taylor album, yall will be saying ‘Joe you’re next’. It’s so wrong. Some aren’t good people but don’t act like you’re part of law enforcement and are actually going to do anything.

Edit 5: thinking about the song High Infidelity (I love Taylor so I’m not slandering) but y’all praised her for cheating ?? Not expecting harassment and it’s a good song but if she had said someone’s cheated on me, you’d be quick to send death threats.

Edit 6: sometimes I feel so ashamed to be a swiftie. Now I can’t even like other peoples music? What’s next? Xx 

Edit 7: remember the Miss Americana documentary? “It’s more than just music at this point” said in tears and dismay. You are adding to that narrative.

Edit 8: some of y’all have never been in a real relationship and it shows.

Edit 9: Taylor singing begin again has been relayed to a post form Joe months ago? Y’all gotta stop. Taylor’s just singing songs she wants to when she wants to",0.82,1486,0,1486,Apprehensive_Ring591,2023-04-23 00:43:48,12vm9h9,t3_12vm9h9

TaylorSwift,I estimated the distance if you ran the setlist...,"So I will start by saying I am a casual runner and after this quote from the Time article about how Taylor started training for the Eras tour really got me going.  
She was quoted saying:  
[""Every day I would run on the treadmill, singing the entire set list out loud,” she said. “Fast for fast songs, and a jog or a fast walk for slow songs."" 
](https://time.com/6342806/person-of-the-year-2023-taylor-swift/). 
 I could not stop thinking about what kind of distance that would be, so I did a rough calculation. 


Answer? Roughly   [ **13.38 miles (or 21.59 km)**   ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-X6Mstppw2K1O8C3H4CrCyRv1ng0T_W3RV9sZvm-mvU/edit?usp=sharing).   
That's 93.67 miles a **week.** 


Some Notes: 
  * Attached is my spreadsheet, Sheet 1 calculates with only tempos being fast and slow. Fast tempo is calculated at (what I googled to be) an average woman's running speed of 6.5 on the treadmill. Fast walking is slow and calculated to be 4.5. 
Sheet 2 is the calculations with a slow (3.0 treadmill speed), moderate (5.0) and fast (6.5) 
 *  There are obviously some difficulties as not all songs were played to completed (Ex: Miss Americana) but for the purpose of my sanity, I kept them all to full length 
 * Some personal decisions made on which songs could be considered fast or slow, generally I went off of tempo, however tried to take into account what she was actually doing during the show.   
So here's some more fun things I calculated: 
 *  Longest distance for a song: All Too Well, second longest: Fearless 
 *  Shortest distance for a song: Tis the Damn Season, followed by Vigilante Shit   

Distance Totals Per Era (in miles):  
 1.  Folklore (1.87) 
 2.  1989 (1.85)
 3.  Lover (1.7) 
 4. Red (1.69)
 5.  Midnights (1.54) 
 6.  Reputation (1.28) 
 7.  Evermore (1.28) 
 8.  Fearless (1.15) 
 9.  Speak Now (.66).

TaylorSwift,Midnights Album Cover. Why?,"*Apologies in advance if this has already been discussed. I did a quick search and didn’t see any recent posts.*

With the announcement of the Midnights (Till Dawn) edition I have become more and more confused by some of the decisions Taylor is making (or allowing to be made by her team). For someone who claims to plan years in advance and is a mastermind at planting elaborate easter eggs in everything, I’m going to ask the question thats been bugging me since the initial release of Midnights.

Why is the album cover not a full photo?! Get rid of the white border and just have her and the lighter. 

Im giving Lover a pass because it MOSTLY fits the pattern. After she completes her re-records she will have an entire catalog with full art album covers that are easily distinguishable eras in their own. 

I can “slightly” buy the excuse of it being that way due to the clock idea for the back covers. But, I still dont think that reason alone is enough to result what will be an obvious sore thumb in the album line-up after the release of all the re-records (assuming she stays on theme with the others). Id be dumbfounded if this was not brought to attention in one of her meetings with her team at some point and if it wasn’t she needs better marketing. 

Any graphic designers or people with experience in merch designs have any thoughts?",0.85,1452,0,1452,scottdH2P,2023-05-25 11:37:12,13rd2y2,t3_13rd2y2

TaylorSwift,The conversation around Taylor Swift in traditionally “masculine” circles is violently shifting and I think it’s important to highlight.,"I know many Swifties here won’t care about this, or will scoff it off with “if they couldn’t just enjoy her to begin with, then who cares?”, but I have a feeling this expanding audience is important to Taylor as it helps her get those accolades and etc. 

As a straight/male Swiftie, I can anecdotally say that since Midnights has released, the popularity of her among people in my circles and that I see online is drastically increasing. I went from being embarrassed for my taste, to it being popular and accepted. 

As much as we may dislike some of these figures for their beliefs, individuals such as Dave Portnoy (head of Barstool Sports) and Aaron Rodgers (NFL quarterback) being public Swifties has really helped men find Swift and take an interest without being ashamed. 

Now I understand in a perfect world, there is nothing to be ashamed with from the start, but in the mainstream it’s important to have supporters like this because perhaps it changes some guys from the mindset of “useless pop girl who sings about breakups” to “wow she’s actually really good and diverse”. 

I am not saying that Taylor Swift needs the validation of men to be successful by any means, but I genuinely love how her fanbase is becoming more diverse. The New York Yankees doing a tiktok where they ask all the players they’re favorite Taylor Swift song may seem like no big deal, but I feel this exposure from a very unconventional source truly shows how she’s growing. 

Again, none of this is to say that she needs any of this, but the acceptance of being a Swiftie has definitely grown since Midnights. Any thoughts?",0.92,1411,0,1411,Beginning-Benefit929,2023-07-11 15:15:51,14wr4c7,t3_14wr4c7

TaylorSwift,"Hot take: The “emotion”, and “sense of urgency” you miss from the originals were actually just improper vocal technique that Taylor has since improved upon","I think almost everybody can agree that Taylor has become a much better singer in recent years. She’s no longer struggling to sing her music, and I think that’s the difference that a lot of people are hearing. All of the breaths and shakiness that created that “sense of urgency“ that I see a lot of people commenting on aren’t there anymore because she sings with a lot more ease now. I think a good example is Style. When she sings the second half of chorus the second time, she just hits the words “shirt”, “skirt”, “time” directly, where as in the original they’re a lot more shaky (not really vibrato, which Taylor doesn’t typically use). Basically, if she’s not taking the breaths that create the emotion that you remember, it’s because she doesn’t need to anymore.

TaylorSwift,"r/TaylorSwift will be going dark on June 12 in support of the community protest against Reddit’s proposed API changes, which will end 3rd party apps","#Don't Let Reddit Kill 3rd Party Apps!

###What's going on?
A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users. This will have a huge impact on visually impaired people as screen readers require 3rd party apps. In addition, more spam will be able to fall through the cracks, including NSFW content. 


On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader.

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

###What's the plan?
On June 12th, r/TaylorSwift will be going dark for at least 48 hours. This means that no posts or comments will be allowed. 

Many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can you do?

1. Complain. Message the mods of r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a support request: comment in relevant threads on r/reddit, such as this one, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

2. Spread the word. Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at r/ModCoord - but please don’t pester mods you don’t know by simply spamming their modmail.

3. Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit’s competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

Don't be a jerk. As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible. This includes not harassing moderators of subreddits who have chosen not to take part: no one likes a missionary, a used-car salesman, or a flame warrior.

TaylorSwift,"RESULTS: Testing the ""every Taylor Swift song is someone's favorite"" hypothesis.","Hello there! This week, I decided to run an experiment here on r/TaylorSwift: testing the hypothesis that ""every Taylor Swift song is someone's favorite"". All original songs and collabs were included. Remixes were only included when they featured an artist not in the original. Was this a flawless method of collecting data? No. Do I think the results are interesting? Yeah!

**5,640** of you made the impossible decision and responded to the survey. I'm so grateful to every one of you! You've given me lots of neat data to work with, and I hope you enjoy the results as much as I've enjoyed preparing them.

I'll admit I made a few mistakes in the survey. I accidentally omitted Beautiful Ghosts as well as the collab Anti-Hero remix (not because I don't love them!) Sorry about that, my bad.

Did any songs receive 0 votes? Yep. Cue the sad music, because these are the songs that *literally not one single person out of more than five thousand* chose as their favorite.

|Song|Votes|
|:-|:-|
|*Beautiful Eyes*|0|
|*Both of Us*|0|
|*Highway Don't Care*|0|
|*We Were Happy*|0|

If not for *We Were Happy*, every album track would have at least one vote.

Because I know you're wondering, 8 people picked *ME!* as their favorite. Whether they were joking or not will forever be a mystery.

Also, I'd say this disproves the ""every song is someone's fav"" hypothesis, but with the literally millions of Swifties out there I'm sure there's at least someone who has each of these tracks as their all-time fav.

Here are the songs that received only 1 vote. If you voted for one of these, congratulations, you were the only one.

&amp;#x200B;

|Song|Votes|
|:-|:-|
|*A Perfectly Good Heart*|1|
|*Birch*|1|
|*Christmas Must Be Something More*|1|
|*Gasoline*|1|
|*I Don't Wanna Live Forever*|1|
|*The Joker and the Queen*|1|
|*Run*|1|

To the surprise of absolutely nobody, *All Too Well (10 Minute Version)* was the most selected song. In case you're curious, here are the top 13 most voted songs:

&amp;#x200B;

|Song|Votes|
|:-|:-|
|*All Too Well (10 Minute Version)*|271|
|*Right Where You Left Me*|153|
|*August*|118|
|*Cruel Summer*|108|
|*Enchanted*|106|
|*Ivy*|105|
|*Would've, Could've, Should've*|104|
|*Cowboy Like Me*|102|
|*Peace*|100|
|*Champagne Problems*|99|
|*Cardigan*|94|
|*My Tears Ricochet*|90|
|*You're On Your Own, Kid*|89|

I must say, I'm pleasantly surprised to see that *Peace* and *Cowboy Like Me* were this high, despite not being ""fan favorites"". They seem to have trusty groups of very loyal supporters despite traditionally ranking lower from what I've seen, which is awesome!

I expected the results to follow the Pareto Principle, which states that 80% of the votes should come from 20% of the songs. However, this did not apply; in this case, 80% of the votes came from 38% of the songs.

Here's the most voted song from each album...

|Album|Song|Votes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*Taylor Swift*|*Mary's Song*|17|
|*Fearless*|*You Belong With Me*|26|
|*Speak Now*|*Enchanted*|106|
|*Red*|*All Too Well (10 Minute Version)*|271|
|*1989*|*Clean*|77|
|*Reputation*|*Call It What You Want*|64|
|*Lover*|*Cruel Summer*|108|
|*Folklore*|*August*|118|
|*Evermore*|*Right Where You Left Me*|153|
|*Midnights*|*Would've, Could've, Should've*|104|
|Other|*Safe and Sound*|27|

And here's the number of votes each album received.

&amp;#x200B;

|Album|Total Votes|Avg. Per Track|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*Taylor Swift*|96|6.86|
|*Fearless*|248|9.54|
|*Speak Now*|501|27.83|
|*Red*|797|26.57|
|*1989*|569|43.77|
|*Reputation*|430|28.67|
|*Lover*|580|32.22|
|*Folklore*|996|58.59|
|*Evermore*|823|48.41|
|*Midnights*|500|23.81|
|Other|101|5.05|

It's worth noting the last column is an unfair way to pit the albums against each other because those with more tracks have to have their averages ""dragged down"" more.

With only 1.7% of the total votes, Debut is the least loved album. With 17.7% of the votes, Folklore is the most loved. That means the most voted album received ten times as many votes as the least voted.

So, what's the verdict? Is every Taylor Swift song someone's favorite? The answer is probably yes. There are 4 songs that received 0 votes - two of them collabs, one an extremely obscure country deep cut. But like I said before, with the millions of fans out there I'd say there's at least someone with each of these as their fav. Ignoring the collabs - which by some definitions aren't even ""Taylor Swift songs"" - I'd say *We Were Happy* and *Beautiful Eyes* are the least-loved Taylor Swift songs. And that's a pretty depressing verdict. Everyone go give these songs some love! I wouldn't call any of them bad. Like some of you said, choosing just one song as your favorite is a nearly impossible decision.

TaylorSwift,Big Machine Records interfering with Taylor's artistic vision,"Big Machine Records was completely clueless about how to guide Taylor's career. Thankfully, Taylor was savvy and intuitive and always held her ground. 

\- Working with Nathan Chapman as her producer: 

Nathan had no professional experience before producing Taylor's demos. Big Machine wanted her to work with experienced producers but Taylor liked working with Nathan and had to beg for him to be her main producer on her debut. 

 “After a lot of begging and pleading, I got my label to agree to let Nathan Chapman produce my entire first album.” 

\- Putting Our Song on Debut: 

Our Song was her biggest hit from debut and her first number one on the country charts, yet Big Machine did not even want her to record the song. 

2007:  “When we were picking songs for the album, I stood by this one and made sure it got recorded. I just knew there was something about it.”  

2012:  “So I went to my record label, and I said to the guy at the record label, ‘I really think we should put this song on the record because my friends at high school love it.’ And he was like, ‘Now, you can’t just make all of your decisions about a very serious thing like an album based on if your high school friends like it or not.’ And it ended up being our first number one at country radio so I guess you can!” 

\- You Belong With Me: 

""Over two-and-a-half-hours, Swift and Chapman had recorded most of the song, and later that day, a Big Machine employee told them, “It’s not cool to take that much time for one song.” Swift and Chapman had bucked the label’s expectations regarding genre, as Big Machine was used to a simple, three-piece band. In response, Swift recorded four more songs that afternoon, leaving her “worn out” to the point that her management called Chapman the next day."" 

""Chapman revealed that the iconic opening with its banjo and instrumental loop were Swift’s idea, which she asked him to execute. Chapman had to “remake \[the intro\] four or five different ways” after Big Machine shut it down, and he described Swift’s subsequent discussion with her label as a “back-and-forth”. Big Machine thought the intro was “really electronic” and didn’t like that."" 

“The first version of Taylor asking for that and me sending her something on email is what ended up making the record. But it’s amazing the little battles you can end up fighting with the label and different people over little parts like that. That was about two weeks on-and-off of my life spent on that intro.”  

\- Pop songs on Red: 

Taylor was only allowed to put 3 pop songs on Red.  

“We went and we did three songs, two of which were ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ and ‘We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together’, and that was as much as I was kind of allowed to work with Max on that project.” 

\- 1989 era: 

 “A lot of me making this album was me going in the studio, making something I loved, and showing it to the label and getting a principle’s-office discussion. Like, “Young lady, you know you’re not going to sell as many albums if you’re not labeled as country.” I wasn’t kicking and screaming, but I was very firm about the fact that to call this album a country album would be the biggest mistake. Because when you’re trying to fool people, you insinuating that you think they’re stupid. And insinuating that people aren’t going to see through your transparent motives is the one worst mistake you can make as an artist who is supposed to respect their fans. That was my argument.”  

 “When she first turned in the record, she says the head of her label, Scott Borchetta, told her, ‘This is extraordinary – it’s the best album you’ve ever done. Can you just give me three country songs?’” The label wanted a pop album with country window dressings so they could promote *1989* to Swift’s two primary genres."" 

“It felt disingenuous to try to exploit two genres when your album falls in only one. I never want to pull the wool over people’s eyes, because people are so much smarter than a lot of marketing professionals give them credit for.”  

“And the decision to make a pop album was not made in a conference room at a record label. Those decisions were made in my kitchen, with my girlfriends, and the women in my life. And so, I want to thank my friends, you guys were always there when I had questions, ‘Do you like this song? Is this the right direction to go in?’ They were the ones who reinforced me and said, ‘You’re doing the right thing, always follow that.’” 

""she mentioned that Borchetta requested three country songs, she added that he said, “Can we put a fiddle on ‘Shake it Off’?""""

“I got really, really lectured about not putting my name on the title on the front of the album cover—that was fun. And then it was suggested to me that we use a different picture for the album cover because, they kept saying, “We need eyes, lips, hair on an album cover. You know no one’s going to know who this is.” And I was like, “That’s the point. We’re starting over.” Also, the reason I didn’t put my full face on the cover is because I didn’t want people to be able to diagnose the emotional DNA of this album before it came out. If I’m smiling, it’s a happy record; if I’m frowning, it’s a sad record. I wanted people to be able to detect no emotion on my face. It was just taken on this ’80s Polaroid camera that I have.” ",0.95,1368,0,1368,Familiar_Pace8718,2023-06-27 10:07:20,14k7e2o,t3_14k7e2o

TaylorSwift,"Unpopular opinion: I'm GLAD there are no features on 1989 TV, especially Harry Styles","I would like to preface this by saying that Harry is one of my FAVORITE artists. I love his work on 1D and his solo projects.

With that said, I'm glad he hasn't done anything with Taylor, regarding their music. Taylor Lautner made sense. Taylor L and Taylor S have both spoken about their respect and admiration for the other, and are fans of each other's work. Taylor L's wife is also a HUGE fan. Him being featured with SNTV makes a LOT more sense.

With Harry, he and Taylor haven't even acknowledged each other in ANY way, apart from a few conversations at award shows. During 2013, when they dated, they were VERY heavily scrutinized and speculated about by the media and the press. Yes, she was as well during 2009-2010 before Speak Now og, but it was ESPECIALLY heavy between Red and 1989. A lot of songs on 1989 allude to this: Blank Space being about the character she was seen as, Shake It Off mentions a few lyrics like ""I go on too many dates but I can't make 'em stay, at least that's what people say"", New Romantics has lyrics like ""I could build a castle out of all the bricks they through at me"", and I Know Places is about hiding from the papparazi.

While yes, a Harry collab would be AMAZING, I just don't think it's likely, ESPECIALLY on songs like Style or Out of the Woods, where she's basically confirming who the song is about, which she hasn't done since she was a teenager. No matter how much you think you know who a song is about, unless their name is plastered through the lyrics or she actually says, you can never be for sure.

Now, with the features in general: as a whole, her features are never really the most loved. Of course, ever song has its cult following, and I really like some of them, but generally, they're never that popular. You don't see people gushing over You All Over Me or evermore the way you do with august or All Too Well (10).

Also, 1989 was ABOUT her stepping into pop, and finding her footing on her own. It was marketed as an album about her friends, but also as one she sang on her own. Speak Now was similar, and it DID have features recently, but it didn't have the same original impact as 1989.

I've seen people say stuff like ""the back covers are just place holders, and the REAL vault songs will have features"" but why would she do that? With Speak Now, she didn't release the back covers, and then release Electric Touch without Fall Out Boy. (she did kinda with Maren Morris, though lol)

Maybe this is just me though. This is just MY opinion, and we can all agree to disagree lol

TL;DR: a Harry Styles feature was unrealistic, and collabs as a whole are usually never too popular.

Edit: I would love a Harry/Taylor collab on a NEW album or NEW song, just not 1989tv. With 1989, it's just confirming rumours that they have both fought so hard to avoid. But with new work, sure, there would be the shippers, but overall, it'd just be seen as another feature. ",0.94,1362,0,1362,Leak_Acid_Rain0907,2023-09-21 03:45:24,16o32g9,t3_16o32g9
TaylorSwift,I've been a hater for years. I was wrong.,"So, for starters I'm a nearly 30 year old father of twin girls. Not the target market for her at all. I remember when Taylor first started blowing up when I was in middle school. I was a big classic rock/metalhead guy in those days so of course my immediate response was ""Oh hell no"". I was not a fan of her country-pop music, I actively rejected it. And I kept that impression for years that TSwift was always, in my head, the girl that sang Tim McGraw and Teardrops on my Guitar. Admittedly a big part of it is due to misogyny. The mindset that tells me ""Oh, this is stuff teenage girls like. If teenage girls like it, it's automatically bad."" but I realized I can't keep that character defect. I don't want my daughters growing up thinking I hate the media that they're into.

I heard about the re-recordings of her albums and thought it was neat. But when I looked deeper into it and heard her story about why she's doing it (Thanks Rick Beato) I thought it was an absolutely genius move. As a musician myself, it really struck a chord in me that her masters were placed in the hands of somebody she actively disgusts and wants nothing to do with. What she's doing right now is going to change the music industry FOREVER. And for good.

So on a long drive home one day I decided to skip my usual Beach Boys playlist and put on Folklore. And holy SHIT I was floored. I thought this album was fantastic, way different than what I expected her music to be like these days. I've heard a few hit singles here and there from her previous works but never really LISTENED to it. Mirrorball and This Is Me Trying really stuck out to me. Absolutely love Mirrorball especially, that little tinge of dream pop influence really gets me going. After that I listened to Evermore and Midnights. And let me tell you, I loved Evermore but I really fell in love with Midnights. 

So; Sorry for being a hater for all these years. I was wrong. I'm going back through her discography now (listening to TV when applicable) and really enjoy most of it. Her decision to boldly re-record her albums has turned me into a full-time Swiftie. ",0.96,1365,0,1365,Cork0nThe0cean,2023-07-06 19:59:56,14sgsqe,t3_14sgsqe

TaylorSwift,I don't understand what's wrong with criticizing the re-recordings.,"Don't get me wrong, it does suck to see people hate on them. This situation with 1989 TV has been especially bad. There's been a lot of overreactions that'll probably calm down eventually. But there have been some complaints that I think are valid.

Some songs have changes that are just quite jarring or don't sound as good, which is understandable. There's also complaints about how Taylor sings, whether it's a note change or it just doesn't have as much emotion. I know it's been years, so Taylor may not be feeling the same emotions as before, but I feel like that's not entirely an excuse for them to have less emotion. I mean, Is It Over Now has emotion in it, but some could argue that Style or Out Of The Woods don't.

Style definitely got it the worst I feel. The instruments and Taylor's voice sound a bit off at certain points. For example, Taylor's voice sounds weirdly deep when she says ""that you've been out and about with some other girl.""

*edit* I just wanna add that in Shake It Off, there's this weird snipping noise during the second verse that wasn't there in the OG. Out of all the production changes, this one has definitely been bothering me 😅

Then there's fans that bring up the fact that the re-recordings are just a passion project and that the main goal is ownership. They don't neccessarily need to replace the OGs if fans prefer those more. That's true - you can always listen to those instead. But I feel like the fact that these are the ones that are going to be used from now on is enough of a reason for this re-recording process to be important and handled well.

At the end of the day, I still really enjoy the re-recordings. 1989 TV is no exception. But I can understand why fans are having a difficult time. I think the criticism that the re-recordings have gotten are mostly valid. The only argument I have is that we're basically at the end of the re-recording process and Rep/Debut are probably close to being finished (might already be finished), so these complaints are a bit in vain 🥲",0.83,1355,0,1355,BidoofTheGoat,2023-10-29 09:21:34,17iyejq,t3_17iyejq

TaylorSwift,Why so many negative comments towards people who choose to sit for the concert?,"Sometimes on Twitter or in the megathreads I’ll see people talking about how those sitting down near them looked like they “didn’t want to be there at all” or must have only been there for a couple of songs and weren’t “real fans.” Just today I saw someone sounding upset that someone else around them sat down during a slower song. 

But I guess I’m just like…the seats are there for a reason? There are so many reasons why someone might want to sit and/or not scream during a show that have nothing to do with how much they do or don’t like the artist. I personally was THRILLED to be there but sang very quietly and alternated between standing up and sitting down. I had long walks to and from my car and didn’t want to be thinking about my feet hurting instead of Taylor. My sister who came with me was very quiet for most of the show because she’s a music teacher and knew that she could accidentally hurt her voice if she let herself go into banshee shrieking mode. 

But the thing is, all of that was our version of enjoying the show just as much as the people who were dancing and shouting. I love to sit back, watch artists do their thing, and soak in the spectacle because it’s what I paid to come see. It’s also probably not unrelated to the fact that I’m a big theatre fan so I’m used to that environment where you’re meant to be quiet and let the professionals onstage do their thing. And it wasn’t going to affect Taylor’s perception of our audience’s energy whatsoever that I decided to sit down in the nosebleeds. 

To be clear, I’m not hating on anyone who wants to scream or dance during a Taylor show. I just get frustrated with those who act like people who don’t are somehow lesser fans of her when in reality we all just like to experience things differently.

Edit: wow I left for a couple of hours and came back to so many comments! Thanks for sharing your experiences. I meant to include in my original post that it’s ableist to expect everyone to be able to stand for 3+ hours so thanks to those who brought that up",0.96,1351,0,1351,falling-15,2023-07-02 16:12:39,14opby3,t3_14opby3

TaylorSwift,Unpopular opinion: I prefer the original arrangement/lyrics of All Too Well over the 10 Minute Version.,"Hear me out!

1. I’m a creature of habit and a bitch for nostalgia, so I generally don’t love when things I love get revamped. So here is my disclaimer up front that it’s me, hi, I’m probably the problem. :)

2. I truly feel like the OG version flows better. The 10MV feels clunky to me and the transitions from the OG verses to the new 10MV verses are abrupt because her songwriting style is so different now compared to how it was back then…. which leads into how I’m totally convinced that there was no “original” ATW10MV, and she absolutely just wrote some additional verses to create the 10MV because of a hyperbole that fans totally latched onto. I feel like maybe this part isn’t totally unpopular, but it’s the reason why I don’t love the flow of the 10MV.

3. This is probably the most important for me and I feel like it isn’t discussed a ton! I think the 10MV changes the narrative. It’s lovely that Taylor was able to create something so personal, but the OG was a better self insert. The specificity of the 10MV doesn’t really work as a “look out the window and pretend this song was written about the shitty breakup I just went through” song without ignoring half the lyrics… it’s so evidently about Taylor and Jake that I can’t hear anything else. The 10MV also evokes a lot more anger than nostalgia/bittersweet memories. Obviously both were present in the OG, but the ratio of these emotions flips with the ATW10MV… the OG felt like 70% nostalgia 30% anger, 10MV feels like 70% anger, 30% nostalgia. Which makes sense because (IMO) she was likely much angrier about the relationship and the way she was treated as time went on and she became more aware of the age gap/power dynamic that was at play.

I do really like both but the OGV just hits better for me. ❤️",0.87,1335,0,1335,[deleted],2023-06-06 22:45:21,142spr9,t3_142spr9

TaylorSwift,I got a First Class result on my Master’s dissertation about Taylor Swift!,"It’s me. Hi. 

About a year ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/vk3313/i_have_been_approved_to_write_about_taylor_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about my Master’s dissertation on Taylor Swift as a Confessional Woman, and I’m happy to report that the marking went very well! The final title was “Popstar Poetics: Taylor Swift and the Confessional Woman.”I actually don’t know if I’m able to post anything from it publicly, but I am happy to share it privately with a few friends if they’re interested ;) 

Fair warning, it *is* like 80 pages long and also heavily concerned with 1960s Confessional poetry, so it’s not a quick read lol. But, I’m mostly happy to see such a positive response to an academic analysis of Taylor’s music!

This sub is one of my favorite places on the internet, and easily one of the top reasons I felt so confident pursuing this diss in the first place. I love analyzing Taylor’s music, and it’s always such a pleasure to share in that with a thoughtful community like r/TaylorSwift. So shout out to all of you!! 

(Also, I *just* graduated, which is why I finally feel safe to share my news, but I wanted to update you guys on how it went in order to encourage other academic Swifties to be confident in their knowledge and possible Taylor-related topics!)

EDIT: Can I officially consider myself a Taylor Swift scholar???

EDIT AGAIN: Omg you guys are seriously so sweet. I am so, so appreciative of all the love and interest!! If you want to see a copy of my diss and are comfortable sharing an email address, just shoot me a message, and I’ll send it over!

TaylorSwift,Eras Movie Etiquette,"The movie is such an awesome thing for those who couldn't attend the concert, but I'm a little worried about how this experience will pan out. A lot of Swifties are saying that we should treat it like a concert (and I'm all for trading bracelets and dressing up) but I would be bummed if people stood for the entire movie. I have a autoimmune disease and can't stand for long period of time (which is why I never attempted to get concert tickets apart from the fact I couldn't afford them). I guess I could ask the person in front of me to sit down but I guess I feel like I would be ruining their experience? I wish there had been some information on whether the movie would go to streaming services or not (it probably will?). 
Anyhow, I got my tickets for October 14th at 10:30 a.m. so hopefully there's less people who want to wake up and watch it on a Saturday, haha!",0.95,1310,0,1310,unremarkable_enigma,2023-09-01 01:43:41,166r1k2,t3_166r1k2

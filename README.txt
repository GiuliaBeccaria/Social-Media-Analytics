README

This directory is organized as follows:
- PDF (containing the report and presentation)
- Data
- Code

The Code folder includes five notebook files, organized as follows: the first pertains to the collection of data, with the output stored in the Data folder containing the utilized datasets; the second focuses on preprocessing; the third on Social Network Analysis (SNA); the fourth on sentiment analysis; and the fifth on Named Entity Recognition (NER).

We recommend using the provided data, as the data collection code requires a secret token for the Reddit API. 
The authors of this project are Giulia Beccaria and Lorenzo Lobosco.
